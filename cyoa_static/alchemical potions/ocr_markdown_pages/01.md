# Alchemical Potions

Having no purpose in life, after graduating from your magic academy you picked up the hobby of making potions with your alchemy skill, and selling them in your local market. It wasn't much, but you were making some good cash on the side. After a couple months of the same routine, you had a realization. You loved making potions, but not only that, you were good at making potions too! So fed up with the same boring routine you've been living through, you came to a decision. You were going to open up your own store! After a couple weeks of searching, you come to another realization. You are too broke. Sure you got a nice sum of money from your market sales, but that wasn't nearly enough to get a store. What do you do now? As you began to ponder your options, you remembered seeing an ad in the papers: "By chance are you looking into purchasing a store for cheap? If so, contact me by sending a letter to..." It was worth a shot! You send a letter, and within the next couple days, you get a response:

"I'm very happy that you're interested. I'm a Plant Mage, and the store is where I used to sell my plants. If you drop by the village of Lustford, you can begin to set up shop. Let's say if you can pay me 150 Gold by the end of the week, you can have the store for good. Does that sound good?"

And with that, you began your journey to Lustford. Once you arrive at the quaint town of Lustford, you come to notice something. Everyone in the town was HOT. Like, ridiculously hot. You'd like to think that you weren't too terrible to look at, but these people were on another level. Keeping yourself focused, you decide to make your way to the address of your new store. As you walk into the rather small building, you begin to imagine how your store will look once you have everything set up. Your eyes soon found a note laying on the counter, written by the previous owner:

"From one store owner to another, I'd like to say that the people of Lustford are rather... interesting. Let's just say, there's a reason the town's called LUST-ford. Some customers might ask for something extra, in return for more cash, if you catch my drift. Good luck, and see you in a week..."

## Scavenging

Well that is that. It was still very early in the morning in the village of Lustford, and you didn't intend to open your store for at least a couple more hours. You didn't bring anything with you except some living essentials, and the equipment you needed for alchemy, so you grabbed a map of the surroundings and a book of ingredients used in alchemy, and began scavenging.

(To make potions, you will need to scavenge for ingredients. These ingredients can be found throughout the land around Lustford, but will take quite a bit of energy to get them. Each morning, you will start with 15 Energy Points. These points can be used to scavenge for ingredients. These ingredients can then be used to make potions, where it can then be sold to customers. After "going to sleep" at the end of each day, you'll wake up and will come back to this portion, where you'll have 15 Energy Points again to scavenge for more items. Whatever ingredients you didn't use to make potions, can be used on later days.)

- **Fluids of a Succubus**
  Energy req: 3 Points  
  Collected: 60ml of Fluids  
  Description: Fluids of a succubus are a very useful ingredient, used in a variety of potions, but mostly used in potions of the sexual kind. These fluids can be anything from the blood, or even tears of a succubus, but fluids produced during sex are the easiest to get... and the most abundant.  
  "Oh? So you want some of my fluids, don't you? Well, it just so happens that I want some of your fluids too, so how's about a trade! Deal?" -A Succubus

- **Milk from Minotaurs**
  Energy req: 1 Point  
  Collected: 100ml of Milk  
  Description: Minotaurs used to be fierce creatures that could destroy whole villages by themselves, but recently they've been domesticated to be a lot less dangerous. If you want some of their sweet minotaur milk, just go ahead and ask for it. I'm sure they'll happily oblige.  
  "You want some of my milk? Of course, you can have as much as you want. Just be gentle with them, alright? They're sensitive y'know!" -A Minotaur

- **Birdfolk Eggs**
  Energy req: 2 Points  
  Collected: 2 Eggs  
  Description: Birdfolk are the cheerful, playful residents of the Lustford Forest. Every once in a while, the Birdfolk produce eggs that, if fertilized, will hatch into another Birdfolk. Unfertilized eggs are a useful ingredient. If you ask nicely, you might get one from them.  
  "So you want one of my eggs, do you? Hmmm... I guess I can give you some, but in return, you'll need to help me make a new egg, if you catch my drift" -A Birdfolk

- **Goo from Slimegirls**
  Energy req: 1 Point  
  Collected: 250ml of Goo  
  Description: Slimes are pretty abundant in the village of Lustford, but in some rare cases, these slimes can evolve into Slimegirls. These slimes produce a goo that is a very useful ingredient in alchemy, and since Slimegirls seem to produce it endlessly, there's more for you!  
  "You really want some of my slime? Sure, go right ahead. It's not like I have any use for this. There's just gonna be less slime for me to clean." -A Slimegirl

- **Fairy Dust**
  Energy req: 3 Points  
  Collected: 20g of Dust  
  Description: Living in the same place as the Birdfolk, Fairies are the mischievous spirits that live in the Lustford Forest. Fairies produce a highly potent magical item called fairy dust. If you ask nicely, they might give you some dust, although it won't be a lot, by any means.  
  "Oh! You wanna get your hands on some of my fairy dust! Alright, I'll give ya some, but you better be patient! Making this stuff takes quite a while!" -A Fairy

- **Lustford's Water**
  Energy req: 1 Point  
  Collected: 250ml of H2O  
  Description: Lustford has a river that passes straight through the village. That river is where most of the denizens of the village get their water from. Water is a very important base of practically all potions, and since the river is open to everyone, it won't be hard to get some.  
  "Traces of aphrodisiacs can be found in the waters of the Lustford river. Maybe that's why the people and monsters of the town of Lustford are so sexual..." -You

- **Essence of Elemental**
  Energy req: 2 Points  
  Collected: 2 Essences  
  Description: Elemental Essences, when distilled into a potion, can give the user the ability to control or resist one of the four main elements. While many think Elementals are dangerous, most of them just want company. If you spend some time with them, they'd be happy to give you their Essences.  
  "Oh, have we ever met? Oh, you came for some of my Essence? Sure you can have some, but before that, how's your day been going? Are you well?" -An Elemental

- **Dragon Scale**
  Energy req: 4 Points  
  Collected: 2 Scales  
  Description: Dragons are the fiercest and most dangerous monsters in the land where Lustford resides. Their scales are nigh impenetrable, which makes them all the more valuable in potions and in alchemy. If you beg, I'm sure they'll give you one... You probably won't get eaten.  
  "You dare interrupt my slumber! What? You want some of my scales? ...Fine, I'll give you some, but only because you don't seem worth the effort to fight" -A Dragon

- **Seeds from a Dryad**
  Energy req: 3 Points  
  Collected: 3 Dryad Seeds  
  Description: Dryads are spirits that live in forests and woods. They care deeply for nature and everything within it. Dryad seeds are very potent seeds that are said to be able to sprout an entire forest. If you help the dryad to grow more plants, they'll happily give you seeds.  
  "Ah, so you search for my seeds, do you? Well, I'm sure I can give you some, but in return, I'll need some of your own seed, if you understand what I mean-" -A Dryad

## Alchemy

After scavenging around the Lustford woods for plenty of hours, you came back to your store with all your spoils. Now you checked and saw you had only an hour or so left until (hopefully) many customers started pouring into your new potion shop. You rolled up your sleeves, set up the cauldrons and cleaned your flasks, and began your favorite part. Alchemy!

(This is the section where you'll be making the potions. Using the ingredients you found in the previous sections that you "scavenged for," you'll be able to create whatever potions you want, as long as you use the correct ingredients. These potions can then be sold to customers for Gold, or other things. You're also able to "Enhance" potions by adding some Fairy Dust into the mix. These enhanced versions of the potions can be sold for more Gold. This is another section you do every time after a day. Every time you "Wake up," you'll go Scavenging, then you'll do Alchemy in preparation for Customers.)
