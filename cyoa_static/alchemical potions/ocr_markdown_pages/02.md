# Day 1

You sat for hours, mixing your ingredients together until you deemed you made enough. With your potions made, it was finally time to open your doors to the world. You put the signs up on the shelves and labels on all the potion flasks, and sat back in your seat. Now all you had to do was wait for the customers to start pouring in.

## Customers
(Customers are the people that'll pay for your potions. Every customer will have a certain problem that can be fixed with a certain potion. They will state what potions they need, and how much they'll pay for them. Customers also have a relationship with you, shown by how many stars they have. The more stars, the better your relationship with them will be, and if you earn all five stars, then they'll pay double of whatever is stated. Some customers start with no stars while others start with 1 or 2, and every time you sell potions to a customer, their relationship improves by 1 star. By the way, I hope you've saved up some Energy Points, because customers can also give you side quests. These side quests will cost some Energy Points, but can lead you into gaining more Gold, or more Stars. You do not need to give everyone every potion they ask for, or do every side quest given everyday, but the more people you sell to and help, the more Gold you'll get.)

- **Lucia - The Practising Mage**  
  Lucia is an energetic, and eccentric person. She's currently learning and studying to become a mage in an academy a little outside of Lustford. She's been having a little trouble in her studies, but she is determined to keep working until she's the greatest mage ever... or at least until she can graduate. "Oh! You're the new alchemist in town! You see, I really need some extra help in my studies right now. By any chance, do you have something that could help me with this?"  
  - **Luck Potion I** --> 7 Gold  
  - **Luck Potion II** --> 12 Gold  

- **Emily - The Courageous Knight**  
  Emily is a knight. Though strong, and skilled with a sword, she can be quite the ditz. But, she's still a very caring person that would give her life to protect Lustford. Since Lustford isn't that big, she is currently the sole knight, with the occasional adventurer as her back up, but she is determined to keep Lustford safe. "Hm, a new potion store? Let's see... is there anything that could be useful in a fight? There seems to be an increase in monsters around lately, so I'll need some extra help."

  - **Strength Potion II** --> 20 Gold  
  - **Health Potion I** --> 6 Gold  
  - **Health Potion II** --> 11 Gold

  Mila is a very timid girl. She owns a small dairy farm just outside the Lustford village. She usually stays indoors, and doesn't really talk to people a lot. Her farm only contains a handful of minotaurs, so she's able to run her farm by herself. The few times she leaves her farm is spent at the market, where she sells her goods. "Y-you're the new Alchemist, right? Umm... I'm the main supplier of Dairy around here, so I could use some help getting more milk so... Do you have something that might help?"  
  - **Growth Potion I** --> 5 Gold  
  - **Growth Potion II** --> 13 Gold  

- **Aelith - The Lewd Priestess**

Everyday, she works tirelessly in her small temple to please and worship her goddess. She also comes into town to spread her goddesses love and pleasure around the land. "So, you're the new alchemist in town? We don't get many new residents these days. But anyways, I was planning on conducting a ritual today, do you have anything that'd be useful?"  
  - **Libido Potion I** --> 6 Gold  
  - **Libido Potion II** --> 12 Gold  

- No Side Quests Today --

You make your way into your new bedroom, and collapse onto your bed. Your muscles and bones ache from the hard work you put in today, but you couldn't help but feel excited. A new chapter of your life has opened up before you. You couldn't wait to see what tomorrow held. You closed your eyes and began to drift off to sleep. You need to be well rested, in preparation for the next day.

(Congratulations! You've completed your first day as an Alchemist in the village of Lustford. Of course, you weren't given any side quests, but it is your first day after all, but I'm sure you'll be given plenty tomorrow. Now what you'll need to do is go up and do the "Scavenging" and "Alchemy" sections again, then come back down and do Day 2. You'll have to do this loop again for the next couple days too, until you have to pay up your debt. Everything stays the same, you'll start with the same 15 Energy Points every morning and you can use whatever ingredients you have left over from previous days or scavenged for in your potions, unless you have any items that say otherwise. Good luck, and remember to save up enough Gold to pay off your debt.)

## Side Quest - One on One Session

After you were going to close up shop for the day, you're approached by a certain Practising Mage. It seems like she was given an assignment from her academy: Make a potion using the process known as Alchemy. But since her mentor is busy, and she has no clue how to do this, she approaches you with her request. "I really need your help. If it isn't too much to ask, could you come over to my home and help me with my alchemy assignment?"

- **Requires**: 4 Energy Points  
- **If Accepted**: You close your store a little early, and head over to Lucia's home. When you arrive, she prepares you a quick dinner before you begin your tutoring lesson.

  One day, when everyone else left your store, a man with a dark hood walked into your store.

If you are willing to give me what I want, I'm willing to do a trade..."

## Side Quest - The Pleasure Palace

It was almost closing time, and you were just tidying up when Aelith walked in. She looks a little dishevelled, her nun outfit was fitted lousily around her body, revealing a lot more skin than the, already lewd, priest usually does. When she sees you, she grins and quickly approaches you. She grabs onto your hands and pulls you closer into her. "Listen, I really need your help with something... There's a certain ritual I have to do to my goddess, but I need some assistance. So, what do you say?"

- **Requires**: 5 Energy Points  
- **If Accepted**: Aelith practically drags you out of the store, and brings you to her temple. Once inside, she closes the doors and begins to undress, revealing her beautiful curves to you.

You both proceed to "Praise the Goddess" for a couple hours, before you left to go home. You wouldn't mind doing that ritual again.  
- **Reward**: +100ml of Succubus Fluids, +2 Stars

## Side Quest - Some Mischievous Fun

Just before you were about to close, Sara walked in. The first time you met her, things went quite rough, but throughout the week, she slowly started warming up to you. When she walked in, there seemed to be a rather mischievous glint in her eye that usually isn't there on the cold assassin face. When you asked what she was here for, she grinned, and asked if you wanted to have some fun. "Hey Alchemist, I heard that you're pretty close with some of the girls in this town. Why don't we pull some harmless pranks on a couple of them! I promise it'll be fun!"

- **Requires**: 5 Energy Points  
- **If Accepted**: Sara leads you to Aelith's temple, and together, you both set up a couple traps, before running off to watch from afar. The traps weren't harmful, but it certainly would put Aelith into some very compromising positions. It wasn't long before the traps were sprung, and the two of you got to see a rather lewd show, courtesy of the priestess. You weren't expecting Sara to be quite the trouble maker, but you certainly did have fun.  
- **Reward**: +20 Gold, +3 Stars  

# End of the Week

After several days of hard work, you've finally made it to the end of the week, and it was an incredible week, at that. You've gained plenty of loyal customers, that you can say, without a doubt, can be called your friends, and experienced several wonderful nights, filled with pleasure. You can't wait to see what else this new chapter of your life will have in store, but first, there is a matter that requires your attention. It's time to pay off your Debt.

- **If you have Less than 150 Gold**: You've not earned enough to keep the store. You took a chance to move away, and live a life you always wanted, and that chance didn't work out. Your debt will be collected from your personal belongings. Your life as an alchemist, and your life in the village of Lustford have ended. Though it didn't work out this time, remember that life is a long game. There's always other chances, but for now... Your Journey Ends Here.
- **If you have More than 150 Gold**: You did it, you succeeded in prospering, and now, your new life as an alchemist has officially begun. Congratulations, because it's only just the beginning of your journey!

(Congratulations! You've made it through the week, and have proven to be a very capable Alchemist. You've worked hard, made great friends, and had some fun experiences, and it all paid off in the end. Now that this portion is done, you can move onto the section...)

# Moving Forward...

You wake up to another bright and beautiful day in the village of Lustford. The sun is shining through the open window, the birds are singing, and it's a great day to open your store as the official village alchemist. As you begin your morning routine, a thought runs through your mind. You're here to stay. After spending a week in the quaint village, it truly has become a home to you, and you can't wait to spend the rest of your days living and working here. You think back to all the new friends you've made, and can't help but smile. You can't wait to learn even more about them. Who knows? Something interesting might happen with a couple of them...

(Now that you've paid off all your debt, you're now able to stay in the village of Lustford as long as you want. With that, some new relationships are able to blossom. You will be able to enter into a relationship with any of the regulars that shop at your store, but there are 2 requirements. You're able to be in a relationship with, at most, 3 villagers, and the second requirement is that you would've had to Max out their relationship (i.e. collect all their Stars). If you've done that, then the character is able to have a relationship with you. So go ahead, and choose below...)

## Relationship Options

- **Lucia - The Practising Mage**  
  Lucia, who was one of the first people to enter your store, has grown rather fond of you over the last week. She comes by a couple times after classes, just to spend a little more time with you. You've even spent a couple evenings together, where the two of you talked late into the night, or spent some "alone time" together. Though Lucia loves magic, one of her favorite hobbies is actually baking. She had a collection of recipes that she loved to make, and sometimes, she'll even bring you a batch to try. She's actually quite skilled when it comes to baking, and her cookies and cakes are absolutely delicious. Her goal is to open up a magical bakery, where she can mix her love of baking and magic into one.  
  - **Intimacy**: When it comes to intimacy, Lucia isn't innocent or ignorant, but more like inexperienced. But despite her lack of experience, she's very eager to learn, and has a lot of energy. She wants to experiment and learn as much as she can, and will probably drag you along with her on her journey. Be prepared, because once she finds something that she enjoys, she'll want to do it, over and over again.  
  - **Likes**: Learning Magic, Baking Treats  
  - **Kinks**: Experimenting, Being Praised  

- **Emily - The Courageous Knight**  
  Emily is a knight that regularly stops by your store, either just for a visit, or to pick up a potion or two for her patrols around the village. Though, she does have a habit of coming to your store after a fight, and asks if you have a healing potion, which makes you worry. You've spent some time with her, and you know that she's a bit of a ditz, but you admire her courage. Emily has lived in Lustford ever since she was little, and she vowed to protect the village ever since she was given her first sword. She is the sole knight in the village, and is determined to be the protector the village needs. Despite the risks of her job, she will not let the fear of failure, or death stop her. Outside of battle, Emily is one of the nicest people you've met.  
  - **Intimacy**: In the bedroom, Emily is just as bold as she is in combat. She doesn't like to beat around the bush, and prefers to get right to the point. She has high stamina, and she's not inexperienced at both dishing out and receiving pain, but she is willing to slow down and be a little gentler. She's the type of girl to be down for anything, if it means that her partner will feel good.  
  - **Likes**: Swords, Combat, Flowers  
  - **Kinks**: Marathon Sex, Wrestling for Dominance  

- **Mila - The Timid Milkmaid**  
  Unlike a lot of the other villagers in Lustford, Mila is very shy. The first time she came into your store, she could barely even talk. But, over the course of the week, she's started visiting your store quite regularly. She was able to slowly open up, and soon, you've spent a lot of time together, and you've grown quite fond of the thoughtful milkmaid. Mila spends a lot of time alone in her barn, tending to her minotaur, so she isn't the most social of people, especially compared to the other villagers. Though, you're an exception. She loves to spend time with you, and whenever she sees you, she'll have a genuine, happy smile. When you're with her, she doesn't stutter as much, and can speak without much trouble, which is a sign that she is a lot more comfortable with you.  
  - **Intimacy**: When it comes to intimacy, Mila is very innocent. She doesn't really know what she's doing, and will mostly rely on you to teach her, or lead the way. Don't expect her to be too aggressive, and be sure to reassure her that everything is okay. Though, don't mistake her shyness as a lack of desire, because she will be eager to learn.  
  - **Likes**: Minotaur, Her Barn, Milk  
  - **Kinks**: Vanilla, Nipple Play  

- **Aelith - The Lewd Priestess**  
  From the moment the two of you met, the lustful priestess has had her eyes set on you. Aelith is one of your most loyal customers, and the one that is the most intimate with you. Since the first week, the two of you have spent a lot of time together, and she's one of the people you've gotten closest with. You're sure that the Goddess of Love is pleased with the priestess' actions. Being the priestess to this particular goddess, Aelith has had some tough times finding a place that will accept her. But, when she moved into Lustford, she immediately fell in love with the quaint, and accepting village. The people of Lustford didn't care what she was, and welcomed her with open arms, and now, she's found her true home.  
  - **Intimacy**: Her rather aggressive nature could lead you to believe she's more of the dominant type, but she actually prefers to take the more submissive role. She likes to focus more on your pleasure, rather than her own, and she does enjoy a bit of rough treatment, too. However, if you're a bit more on the vanilla side, she's still more than happy to spend a more romantic night with you.  
  - **Likes**: Pleasure, Her Goddess, "Rituals"  
  - **Kinks**: Masochism, Rough Sex, Romance  

- **Madie - The Diligent Farmer**  
  Madie is one of the villagers that lives on a small farm just outside of Lustford. Even though she doesn't have many people in her life, she doesn't seem too bothered by it, and is perfectly content with just having her crops and livestock. However, over the last week, she's gotten closer with you, and now, you're one of the people that she is closest with. When it comes to farming, Madie is a very hard worker. She's the one that grows all the crops in the village, and makes the best use of the soil. She also takes care of the livestock, and has a few pigs and chicken, which provide plenty of meat and eggs for the village. Despite her hard work, she still manages to find some free time to relax, and spend some time with you.  
  - **Intimacy**: When it comes to sex, Madie is quite the wild girl. The hard work she does on her farm has given her a toned body, that she likes to flaunt around whenever she can. Whether that be out in the open on her farm, or when she's inside the privacy of her barn, she doesn't mind putting her body on display, and she enjoys it when you watch and stare.  
  - **Likes**: Her Farm, Working Hard, Relaxing  
  - **Kinks**: Exhibitionism, Voyeurism  

- **Sara - The Cold Assassin**  
  The first encounter you had with Sara was rough. It took a couple days for her to warm up to you, and start visiting you regularly. Despite the rocky start, Sara has grown closer to you, and you're happy to be her friend. You're glad that she's opening up, and being more social, but sometimes, she can be a bit of a prankster, but you're willing to deal with it. Sara has lived in a far darker world than most, but the village of Lustford is her haven, where she can live the life she wants. Though she spends some time away from the village, she always looks forward to returning, and seeing all her friends. She'll never let anyone threaten her haven, and will do whatever it takes to protect the village, and the people in it.  
  - **Intimacy**: Despite the cold and distant demeanour, Sara is rather passionate and sensitive. She can be very loving, and will cherish the person that manages to win her over. If they can see past her cold attitude, and understand her, she'll repay their trust, and open herself up completely. When it comes to intimacy, Sara is quite experienced, and is willing to teach you, or even lead, if you prefer.  
  - **Likes**: Lustford, Pranks, Her Friends  
  - **Kinks**: Romance, Long Sessions  

(Congratulations, you've earned yourself a nice home and a job as the Alchemist of Lustford! Your life in the quaint village has just begun, and it's going to be an amazing life. The people are nice, and your shop is popular, and you've grown close to a few villagers. There's a bright future ahead, and you couldn't be happier!)
