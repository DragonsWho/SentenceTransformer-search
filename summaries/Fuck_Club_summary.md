Plot: You are recruited by a mischievous succubus to manage the Fuck Club, an interdimensional space where arrogant heroines are sent for punishment and re-education. Your task is to transform these proud women into obedient sluts, using the club's magical features and your own creativity. The succubus provides you with a variety of club styles, from a sultan's harem to a hentai school, and a range of features like aphrodisiacs, love potions, and hidden cameras. You can customize the club to your liking, choosing how to train and punish the girls, and even enhance your own abilities with succubus powers. The stakes are high as you balance the club's operations, manage the girls, and ensure they are properly broken and trained to serve you and the club's guests.
