Plot: You wake up in a strange, dimly lit hangar, surrounded by a group of beautiful yet intimidating futanari women. They reveal that they’ve kidnapped you for their own amusement. You’re given one hour to entertain them with whatever means necessary—dance, sing, humiliate yourself, or even fight back. If you fail to keep them entertained, they’ll move on to their “main plan”: raping you relentlessly for days on end. As you scramble to figure out how to survive, fragments of your memory return, hinting at your past and why you might have ended up in this situation. The stakes are high—your freedom, your sanity, and possibly your life hang in the balance.
