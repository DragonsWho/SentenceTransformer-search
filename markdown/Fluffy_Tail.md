## Intro

You never cared for those cheap trinkets or "ancient" artifacts that street vendors try to sell to unsuspecting tourists. Yet, this pendant caught your eye. A gleaming, round crystal encased in a simple brass cage. It didn't even look old or anything, although the boy who sold it to you, a persistent little fellow who trailed tourists on their guided tours, claimed he found it in a cave. A ridiculous lie, but... the crystal was undeniably beautiful, radiating an inner glow that captivated you. So, you handed over a few bucks for the trinket, deciding it would make a fine souvenir of your trip. 
 
You spent the day mesmerized by its otherworldly glow, barely listening to the tour guide. It was amazing what local craftsmen could do with epoxy and glitter! If this was truly an ancient artifact, only kings could afford to bask in such splendor, for it looked really magical, ha!
 
As night fell, you stepped out onto the balcony, drawn by the lure of the crystal's glow one last time before bed. Swatting a persistent mosquito, you accidentally smeared a bit of your own blood on the crystal. As you moved to wipe it clean, the stain vanished on its own... Dismissing it as a trick of the light, you raised the crystal higher, aligning it with the full moon. For a few seconds, you reveled in the indescribably beautiful glow that outshone any diamond or kaleidoscope... until the trinket shattered into a million tiny cracks, disintegrating with a soft pop and covering you in a weightless, iridescent dust.
 
"Achkuy~!" you sneezed, surprisingly cute, and tried to brush the dust from your face, but it was already gone. Maybe the wind had blown it away? Ugh... Cheap souvenirs really aren't worth much - you hadn't even managed to put it on a shelf at home!
 
The empty cage, your only remaining souvenir, served as a bittersweet reminder of the crystal's ethereal beauty and your vacation. But as the years passed, you began to wonder if any of it had really happened...

## Fluffy Tail

You've been hunting in these woods for years. Nimble rabbits, tasty mice, fragrant birds~ no one could escape your sharp fangs! Though not every day was filled with carefree happiness, and sometimes you had to run from danger yourself, you truly enjoyed this life without a care in the world. After all, what more does a fox need than exhilarating freedom and sweet prey?

But sometimes, in your dreams, a beautiful crystal ball would shine and shimmer with enchanting colors, through which you looked at the moon while holding it in your hands... Hands? Paws! Of course, they must have been paws! Because you...

You...

Streams of energy enveloped you more tightly with each passing day, releasing a part of your soul that had been securely protected by an ancient talisman. You remembered more and more, and now whole scenes from your past life flashed through your dreams...

For you were once human! And only now did you realize that it was not a fake souvenir at all, but a priceless treasure of the ancients, an artifact from the mysterious world of magic that was hidden from ordinary people. But how the hell did you know how to perform the Moon Tear Ritual for a complete reincarnation?! It would have been a terrible fate to be stuck in an ordinary animal with a human soul, but...

Foxes were never ordinary animals~ 

Close to the otherworld, foxes not just felt magic like cats, but were ready to become something greater if they were lucky enough to find a source of power. And the pool of mana that enveloped your soul and protected your memory worked quite well!

As your young, cunning body continued to absorb magic and reshape itself according to your desires, you felt the changes taking place within you...

### Kittsune

 A tiny, yet amazingly cute fox with oversized ears and vibrant, eye-catching coloring. You look like a cuddly toy, so irresistibly huggable that no one could resist reaching out to hug you.

![Kittsune](images/R4C1.jpeg)

### White

The sunlight reflects off your pure white fur, making you look almost ethereal. To some, you may appear like a wandering spirit, or decide that you forgot to change your fur for summer... But how could you give up such a rare and breathtaking beauty? 

![White](images/R4C2.jpeg)

### Classic

The classic fox, with its sleek red fur and pointed ears, is the ideal! The only thing that distinguishes you from other foxes are your eyes, which are too clever, too cunning, even for such an insidious predator.

![Classic](images/R4C3.jpeg)

### Winged

Only a fox with wings can be better than a classic! Now you'll be able to hunt more comfortably and explore the world from new heights! Oh, how long have you dreamed of reaching those cheeky birds that taunted you with their songs! 

![Winged](images/R4C4.jpeg)

### Nightmare

Midnight-black with blood-tinged fur that seems to pulse and glow in the eerie moonlight, and your piercing eyes were like two rubies shining in the night. If you sneak up on someone at night and yelp, they'll squeal like a little girl!

![Nightmare](images/R4C5.jpeg)

### Great Fox

 A great, mighty fox. It seems like you could easily carry a man on your back. Or drag him away in your strong fangs! You may not be the sweetest of your sisters, but that's not your problem anymore!

![Great Fox](images/R4C6.jpeg)

## New World

For nearly a year, you roamed the unknown lands in your new form - a swift and graceful fox. Every night, the glowing moon, looking exactly as it did before, served as a constant reminder of your old world, but everything else around you seemed so strange and unfamiliar... Maybe this is some kind of parallel world or something? Whatever it was, as you adapted to your fox form and mastered the magic that flowed through you, you were able to learn many things.

You met lots of wonderful foxes who were happy to play with you, and outside your home forest, you discovered many amazing places and unexpected creatures, and even found people you had been watching curiously for days. Though you have not yet dared to come up to them and could not speak to them, you have learned a lot about their society! Most importantly, you now know that if you ever turn into a human, you will not be bored alone! 

### Lots of Prey

You never really thought about it before... But there's an insane amount of game here! Tasty rabbits are hiding under practically every bush, so catching your breakfast is even quicker than when you used to go to the store! There's so much delicious prey and so few predators, it almost seems strange. But maybe that's how it's supposed to be if humans aren't overhunting? 

![Lots of Prey](images/R6C1.jpeg)

### Bright Nights

The local forests are teeming with luminous insects, especially butterflies, and even some flowers and mosses glow in the dark. During certain seasons, it gets so bright that you could mistake night for day, and you find yourself wistfully remembering the bright lights of the city.

![Bright Nights](images/R6C2.jpeg)

### Biomes

As you traveled, you noticed that the biomes in this world change very abruptly. In just a few kilometers, you can go from sand dunes to lush jungle. And with a few more hours of running, you might find yourself in a dense coniferous forest or on the shore of the sea! It's even strange that other animals don't scatter and grass seeds don't sprout in other places!

![Biomes](images/R6C3.jpeg)

### Free Form

You're not entirely sure if it's normal, but the rock formations in this world can be quite bizarre. Enormous arches, columns of natural stone, and even spirals! You can't recall ever seeing anything like it in your past life, but then again, you weren't exactly a geologist or anything like that... Maybe it's just a unique type of rock?

![Free Form](images/R6C4.jpeg)

### Anomalies

Okay... There's no way this is natural! A few times you've come across absolutely insane mazes of bridges and passages that look like giant honeycombs or... Well, you have no idea what, really! In any case, there's always a thick fog surrounding them, so you didn't dare to go inside...

![Anomalies](images/R6C5.jpeg)

### Rifts

On your travels, you came across huge canyons so often that you even tried to draw a map of them... And with a shudder, you realized that they were not rivers, but enormous cracks radiating from a single point! You can't even imagine the force of the impact or volcanic eruption that must have caused the continent to crack open like this!

![Rifts](images/R6C6.jpeg)

### No Winter

You're certain that you've spent at least several years in this world, but you've never once seen winter or even fall! After summer, spring simply begins again, and so on in a cycle! Well, at least you don't have to freeze your paws off in the snow!

![No Winter](images/R6C7.jpeg)

### Sky Fairies

You've spent many nights gazing at the moon, noticing slight differences in its markings from your memories. Streaks of light often cross the sky, which foxes attribute to sky fairies, but you'd say they look more like satellites... If they didn't sometimes fly in circles and playfully chase each other... 

![Sky Fairies](images/R6C8.jpeg)

### Weird Animals

The animals here often look quite strange. Birds with four wings, creatures with three eyes... You couldn't believe what was happening when you first caught a rabbit by the tail, and it shed it like a lizard! But hey, at least they're still tasty!

![Weird Animals](images/R6C9.jpeg)

### Catacombs

Some caves often lead seamlessly into amazing underground catacombs with ancient temples and mysterious tunnels. It's a shame that it's too dark even for you, and as a fox you can't use a torch... But other foxes say that there are many traps and monsters there, so maybe it's for the best.

![Catacombs](images/R6C10.jpeg)

### Cursed Places

Oh yes, this world is definitely home to some real, terrifying nightmares - you're certain of it! Even though you haven't seen them yet, some places reek of such foul curses that there's no other explanation. The monsters sometimes move around, so once you were even able to warn an unsuspecting traveler!

![Cursed Places](images/R6C11.jpeg)

### Last of Us

You finally find some real people! Turns out there aren't that many... At least you could only find a few settlements with hardly more than a few tens of thousands of intelligent sentients. But hey, the important thing is that now you know exactly where you can live if you manage to turn human!

![Last of Us](images/R6C12.jpeg)

### New Races

It seems that in this world, cities are built not only by humans but also by many other intelligent creatures! Centaurs, minotaurs, lizards, even some cute furry balls! Ha, you bet no one would be surprised by a fox-girl, especially since foxes say that kitsune exist! ...you'll be able to walk on two legs again someday, right?

![New Races](images/R6C13.jpeg)

### Cryptids

Some of the most dangerous predators behave almost like sentient beings. They're so tricky and dangerous that even you have to run and hide from them, and once you even lost a piece of fur from your tail! It's a good thing you can usually smell them, but it must be hard for humans!

![Cryptids](images/R6C14.jpeg)

### Monster Girls

You can't believe it, but several times you've seen real monster-girls! Cute faces, bare breasts, and all that! Oh, and of course some kind of terrifying snake tail, claws, or something like that! But they're actually quite cute, so even though they mostly act like savages, humans often... "interact" with them.

![Monster Girls](images/R6C15.jpeg)

### Elementals

No, this definitely can't be explained by evolution or mutagens! These are elementals! Living flame, water, earth, or air! There are probably more exotic varieties, but you haven't seen them yet. In any case, they're amazing creatures, although you're still too scared to approach them.

![Elementals](images/R6C16.jpeg)

### Popular Shape

Have you noticed that the human girl form is extremely popular among monsters for some reason... Especially the ones who can freely transform like slime-girls! Hell, even when they grow tentacles or hunt, they still leave a cute face and boobs!

![Popular Shape](images/R6C17.jpeg)

### Travelers

You haven't quite figured it out yet, but it seems that almost all young people in this world set out on a journey. Maybe it's some kind of rite of passage or ritual? Or maybe they just want to have fun and see the world? In any case, there are strangers wandering around everywhere, and new faces appear every day!

![Travelers](images/R6C18.jpeg)

### Magical

There is real magic in this world! Oh, well... you probably shouldn't be so surprised by that... But it's still amazing! It seems that only people with a strong magical gift could become true wizards, but even those without such abilities could still cast simple cantrips, small spells that added a touch of enchantment to everyday life. 

![Magical](images/R6C19.jpeg)

### Lewd Miscast

The local mages use special safeguards in their spells, so if they don't work for some reason, there's always some lewd effect. Torn clothes, temporary breast enlargement, arousal, a cycle of dozens of consecutive orgasms, or obedience. It looks funny, but it's probably a lot better than getting your fingers blown off or something!

![Lewd Miscast](images/R6C20.jpeg)

### Place of Power

It seems that people don't notice, but there are special places of power in the forests that emit magic like springs. You have no idea what to do with it yet, but like all the other foxes, you love to lie here and bask in this magic like a cat in the sun.

![Place of Power](images/R6C21.jpeg)

### Cracks

Once, you saw a place of power become overflowing with mana and turn into a glowing rift in space for several days. You were damn curious to take a peek inside, to stick your little red fox snout in there, especially after a person emerged from it, but in the end, fear won out.

![Cracks](images/R6C22.jpeg)

### Hidden Temple

As you wandered, you met a wise fox who led you to a hidden temple of foxes! There was a real kitsune with three tails! When she saw you, she said you didn't have long until your transformation. And your story of reincarnation didn't impress her very much. After all, all souls are reborn, and she often talks to spirits.

![Hidden Temple](images/R6C23.jpeg)

### Holy Foxes

For some reason, foxes are considered sacred, practical holy animals in people's religion. You don't know the details, but it looks like the fox helped Buddha or bite the evil goddess in her butt? In any case, people are always happy to see you and are even ready to give you something tasty! Well... As long as you don't steal their chickens!

![Holy Foxes](images/R6C24.jpeg)

### Horny Men

As far as you can tell all the men here are far hornier than even the most lecherous schoolboy from your past world! They seem to be ready to fuck all day long and don't mind fucking a couple of monster-girls in the evening... In fact, they seem to be willing to fuck anyone at all!

![Horny Men](images/R6C25.jpeg)

### Horny Monsters

Monsters in this world often don't kill people, they use them to breed. They're not sure if they use the girls as live incubators or if they can impregnate them, but they like to fuck them unconscious and fill them to the brim with sperm - that's a fact! ...and it seems like girls sometimes surrender to them on purpose.

![Horny Monsters](images/R6C26.jpeg)

### Horny Plants

Plants aren't inferior to monsters in any way - some of them grow special tentacle vines or emit arousing pollen, so they often fill girls with their sticky seed too! There is still a difference though - they are more of an ambush rapist and cannot stalk their prey.

![Horny Plants](images/R6C27.jpeg)

### Horny Traps

Mimics! There are bloody mimics here that catch and rape anyone they catch! And hell, the foxes told you that some pervert monsters set up special lewd traps in the caves, like one-bar prisons or dildo locks on the doors!

![Horny Traps](images/R6C28.jpeg)

### Horny Opportunists

You've seen it more than once: when a girl accidentally gets stuck in a hole or tangled in a rope, someone is sure to take advantage of her helpless position! Even her beloved pet is ready to rip off her panties and fuck her like a bitch in heat! Although... don't girls try to fit into tight places a little too often?

![Horny Opportunists](images/R6C29.jpeg)

### Horny Horny

Damn, it seems like in this world, everything and everyone wants to fuck some warm girl's hole! You're even starting to get a little scared of becoming human, since as the foxes told you - kitsune are always girls! But they also said that it's a good source of power, so maybe it's for the best?

![Horny Horny](images/R6C30.jpeg)

### Handsome

The people in this world look so much more beautiful than in your past life! At least an 8/10 by your standards. But several times, you've definitely seen 11/10 beauties! And you haven't even met that many people yet!

![Handsome](images/R6C31.jpeg)

### Futas

At first you thought it was some kind of mistake or a sex toy... but no, it seems that some of the beauties here have not only pussy, but also a dick between their legs! There are real Futanari in this world! And they're so shameless that when one of them noticed you staring, she just winked at you and kept jerking off!

![Futas](images/R6C32.jpeg)

### Stretchy

It seems that evolution in this world was quite ruthless! Girls were fucked by monsters so often that now they all have incredibly elastic holes that can easily take even the biggest dicks! If in your past world, sex with a horse was something dangerous, then here it's no big deal!

![Stretchy](images/R6C33.jpeg)

### Big Dicks

Apparently, to better satisfy their women, all the guys here have grown huge dicks. 25 centimeters is the minimum! These hoses are just monstrous, but it seems that everyone loves it even more! Oh, and it seems they're able to cum dozens of times without getting tired!

![Big Dicks](images/R6C34.jpeg)

### Blessed Pregnancy

They say that the goddess Ishtar has accumulated so much energy that she has blessed all living beings, and now any pregnancy is desired, pleasant, and safe. No matter what happens to a girl, the baby will be absolutely healthy, and childbirth will be one unending orgasm.

![Blessed Pregnancy](images/R6C35.jpeg)

### Universal Wombs

Eh... It seems the goddess went a bit overboard, so girls can bear a child from any monster that takes advantage of them... Moreover, all children are desired, so there are no abortions! Girls give birth and will lovingly let go of a child even from the scariest monster, because all children are sacred!

![Universal Wombs](images/R6C36.jpeg)

### Hight Fantasy

You can't exactly say that there's a highly developed civilization here... There's no electricity or internet, right? But still, the local cities are very clean, and there's hot water and plumbing in every home, so it's not all that bad!

![Hight Fantasy](images/R6C37.jpeg)

### Magical Artifacts

Some magical artifacts in the possession of witches look surprisingly similar to things from your past world... Is it just an obvious shape, or is any sufficiently advanced technology indistinguishable from magic, so smartphones were just too similar to magical artifacts?

![Magical Artifacts](images/R6C38.jpeg)

### Mana Crystals

Magical crystals placed inside the body allow you to increase your mana reserves many times over, so... Even the shyest little witch has a very well-stretched anus and wears a giant crystal buttplug all the time! And the most powerful sorceresses even have a noticeably bulging belly!

![Mana Crystals](images/R6C39.jpeg)

### Vending Machines

It seems that the local alchemists and witches have long grown tired of selling magical potions themselves, so they invented real vending machines just like in your world! Just insert a coin and press a button! And these machines are located along roads and at the entrance to all popular dungeons!

![Vending Machines](images/R6C40.jpeg)

### Dark Cults

You haven't encountered them yourself, but you've heard ominous rumors that cunning cultists roam these lands, worshiping all sorts of devious goddesses and frequently kidnapping virgins for their lustful rituals. The girls are even paid for it, so they don't resist too much...

![Dark Cults](images/R6C41.jpeg)

### Common Ritual

Hmm... Actually, it seems that this is quite a common ritual, and not only cultists use it... Often, even calling for rain or healing begins with a witch taking off her panties and summoning a huge, hot demonic dick. Probably demons help them in exchange?

![Common Ritual](images/R6C42.jpeg)

### Foxes' Night

According to legend, people put on fox masks so that kitsune can walk among humans and have fun... But in reality, everyone hides behind the masks to indulge in crazy debauchery with no consequences! And if a girl is recognized, she can always say that she was possessed by the spirit of a fox!

![Foxes' Night](images/R6C43.jpeg)

### Maiden Warriors

For you, it looks very unusual, but a significant portion of the warriors in this world are beautiful girls... Who usually wear very provocative and lewd armor! Often it's just armor bikinis! Guys also fight, but usually they're stern, bloodthirsty brutes.

![Maiden Warriors](images/R6C44.jpeg)

### Circle of Life

Of course... Girls just take advantage of the fact that monsters never kill them, only capture! Where a guy would say goodbye to life, they're just raped for a few days! The fact that they give birth to monsters is considered natural, and being pregnant only a few months out of the year is considered an excellent result.

![Circle of Life](images/R6C45.jpeg)

### Public Punishments

Sexual punishment is common in this world, so you can often see a thief shackled in the main square with her ass available to everyone. And something tells you that for more serious crimes there are much more severe punishments here...

![Public Punishments](images/R6C46.jpeg)

### Harems

For a long time, you couldn't understand how it was possible that there were so many harems here, even though there weren't that many more girls than guys... It turned out to be much simpler than you thought! It's just that girls often belong to several harems at once, and no one is bothered by it! 

![Harems](images/R6C47.jpeg)

### No Solo

For some reason, people here really don't like to masturbate. Maybe some goddess forbids it? In any case, everyone has long since gotten used to it, so asking a female acquaintance for a quick handjob isn't considered strange. In fact, often they themselves help their friends and even strangers when they have free time!

![No Solo](images/R6C48.jpeg)

### It's Fine

It seems that the concept of 'rape' simply doesn't exist here. Just a little persistent attention... Being fucked by a stranger here is normal, you could even say it's almost a compliment!

![It's Fine](images/R6C49.jpeg)

### One Week

By unspoken agreement, or perhaps again due to the intervention of lustful but caring goddesses, no one here ever kidnaps girls for longer than a week. Even wild goblins usually rape for only a few days before releasing their victim with a belly full of semen!

![One Week](images/R6C50.jpeg)

### Common Slavery

In this world, slavery is thriving. Magical seals, laws, hypnosis, or just brute force - anything goes! In any case, there are plenty of completely powerless girls here, and you need to be careful in the future! Unless, of course, you dream of slavery like those who sell themselves voluntarily...

![Common Slavery](images/R6C51.jpeg)

### Human Farms

Many monsters can only reproduce using girls, so in dark caves, entire human farms can be found where girls are fucked day after day. These can be criminals, slaves, or even volunteers who pay tribute or simply enjoy the process!

![Human Farms](images/R6C52.jpeg)

### Slutty Games

Foolish things like soccer are not very popular here, but much more spectacular and exciting competitions and games are common. Oh... Or rather, much more lewd and lustful ones! It may seem strange to you, but actually, Miss Deepthroat here sounds quite honorable and respectable!

![Slutty Games](images/R6C53.jpeg)

### Safe Taverns

Taverns located along the roads are undoubtedly safe places where no one will ever fight or argue. Gods? Spells? Or maybe just common sense and politeness? In any case, even when you went there, you were only petted and treated to fried chicken!

![Safe Taverns](images/R6C54.jpeg)

## Red Dream

For many moons, you hadn't seen the Lunar Tear in your dreams, and you feared its magic had depleted, for it had fulfilled its purpose of preserving your memory. You had been told that you were on the verge of becoming a kitsune, almost human or perhaps even better, but months had passed, and nothing had changed. The thought of falling just short of the magic needed for the transformation terrified you, and you sought out natural sources of magic, even secretly licking the altars at night, hoping it would help. But the worst of it was that you had no idea how it would happen! Would you suddenly become human? Would your fur shed, and would you run naked, gradually growing in size? Or, even worse, would you become a furry, forever stuck with a fox's snout?

Anxiety robbed you of sleep, and you often leapt up at night, yowling at the moon, nervously twitching your tail... One such night, you rose, thinking you couldn't sleep... but the world around you bloomed in brilliant shades of crimson, your tail seemed to stretch for meters, swaying like a flag in the wind, your paws carried you at unimaginable speed, and the moon was so close that it seemed you could bite it. For several minutes, you playfully raced with the wind and the streams of magic that surrounded you. It was so pleasurable and strange that you could barely think straight with delight! Even the spirits of ancient foxes came to play with you! You longed to frolic with them, to embrace them with your paws, to catch their tails! You felt like a pup, overflowing with happiness and energy. You would have surely squandered all your mana on the games, but one particularly ancient and wise fox spirit, who remembered even the civilizations of old, easily caught you by the scruff and shook you, bringing you to your senses. Only then did you realize that this was not a hallucination or a dream! You were in the spirit world! In this world without words, when the spirit transformed into a lovely maiden with a dozen tails, you immediately understood what you had to do. This was your chance to become human again... no, a kitsune!

## Human form



### Childish

A small and cute, almost childlike body seemed like the right choice for you! After all, you were practically reborn into a new world. So why not have a second childhood?

![Childish](images/R9C1.jpeg)

### Petite

You're so accustomed to looking at people from the bottom up that you decided not to create a tall body. A small and light, short girl with a plump, juicy ass! You'll be very easy to play with, haha!

![Petite](images/R9C2.jpeg)

### Skinny

A slim, graceful and agile body like a ballerina's always seemed so appealing to you! Not a gram of extra fat, small breasts and a slim waist that seems like it could be wrapped around the fingers of two hands!

![Skinny](images/R9C3.jpeg)

### Regular

Maybe you got confused and couldn't think of anything better, or maybe you've just always preferred the beauty of a normal woman's body. Medium breasts, healthy wide hips, soft butt - that's probably the real ideal!

![Regular](images/R9C4.jpeg)

### Comfy

There is nothing quite like the comforting, sweet, and homely beauty - it is the best. Large, soft breasts that invite one to rest their head, a warm, soothing smile, a fluffy tail... Ah, you are ready to care for everyone around you!

![Comfy](images/R9C5.jpeg)

### Bombshell

Hey, you can pick anything, right? Then you need huge tits and ass! 90-60-90 is definitely not enough for you! You will become a real beauty whose proportions will outshine even the most daring sex dolls! 

![Bombshell](images/R9C6.jpeg)

### Active

As a true huntress, you have honed a strong and agile body! A fox must not only be cunning and beautiful, but also able to stand up for herself... or at least know when to run away! Either way, your abs look fantastic!

![Active](images/R9C7.jpeg)

## Ears



## 

Ordinary human ears? Oh no! Absolutely not! Fox ears are a hundred times better! 
Even if you could, you would never give them up, for they are so sensitive and soft! 
This is not even up for discussion!

### Mini

The smallest ones possible. They're very easy to hide, but looking at other foxes, you'll always feel a little bit of envy... Still, they're so cute!

![Mini](images/R11C1.jpeg)

### Compact

A pair of small ears, so amusing to twitch. Perfect for a modest and reserved fox!

![Compact](images/R11C2.jpeg)

### Balanced

The most popular size of ears for fox girls. They can still be hidden with a big hairstyle or a hat, and they look very balanced and proportionate.

![Balanced](images/R11C3.jpeg)

### Majestic

The true pride of any kitsune who is not ashamed to show who she is! These proudly pointed sharp ears will inspire envy and respect in any fox!

![Majestic](images/R11C4.jpeg)

### Long

Especially long ears, they look particularly amusing when you twitch them from side to side and adorably stick out when you try to hide!

![Long](images/R11C5.jpeg)

### Wide

The broad base of these ears allows you to use them like real radar, haha! No, seriously, with them, you'll definitely hear better!

![Wide](images/R11C6.jpeg)

### Extra size

These ears are even bigger than your head! But... hey, you're sure that cuteness can't be overdone! Besides, they're sturdy enough to be grabbed onto~

![Extra size](images/R11C7.jpeg)

## 



### Colored Tips

The tips of your ears will have a different color. White, black, even red, or something more exotic!

![Colored Tips](images/R12C1.jpeg)

### Unicolored

The color of your ears matches the color of your fur, so they're easy to hide. All you have to do is press them down and no one will notice them.

![Unicolored](images/R12C2.jpeg)

### Ear Furnishings

Your ears will be adorned not only with fur, but also with several especially long, springy hairs that will stick out in a very cute way.

![Ear Furnishings](images/R12C3.jpeg)

### Extra Floof

Any fox knows that the fluffier the ears, the better! So you'll have as much of this cute, soft fluff as possible!

![Extra Floof](images/R12C4.jpeg)

### Tassels

You've long been envious of lynxes, so now you'll have a pair of beautiful tufts on the tips of your ears too.

![Tassels](images/R12C5.jpeg)

### Mood indicator

Your ears will always vividly display your mood, twitching and quivering when you're happy and sadly drooping when you're sad.

![Mood indicator](images/R12C6.jpeg)

### Twitchy

You can't control it, but your ears are always attentively listening for any sound and instantly turn towards it, which looks very cute!

![Twitchy](images/R12C7.jpeg)

### Control

You can move your ears at will. Pinch them, wave them, signal to other foxes or even do some funny tricks.

![Control](images/R12C8.jpeg)

### Sensitive

They're so sensitive that even a simple stroke feels absolutely amazing! Oh, it's not an erogenous zone, but it's no less pleasurable!

![Sensitive](images/R12C9.jpeg)

### Funny Hats

You really like different funny hats that only emphasize your uniqueness. Regular hats and caps don't appeal to you at all.

![Funny Hats](images/R12C10.jpeg)

### Can't Cover

Your ears are too sensitive to be pinched by any, even the most delicate beanie! So thanks to magic, they'll go through the caps.

![Can't Cover](images/R12C11.jpeg)

### Freezing

Your ears have become sensitive to the cold, so if you're wearing a scarf you'll definitely need to cover your ears with cute warm ear muffs.

![Freezing](images/R12C12.jpeg)

## Tail



##  

Haha, if you used to sometimes think about becoming an ordinary human, now you know for sure that you would never give up your tail! You're a proud fox, not some tailless mutt! And your red, soft tail should stay with you!

### Scruffy

Short and stubby, this tail is the bare minimum you can agree to! It's easy to hide, but every time you're naked, you'll feel a little awkward and ashamed that it's so small.

![Scruffy](images/R14C1.jpeg)

### Lanky

An elongated tail, which is very convenient to swing from side to side, but difficult to use as a soft pillow. At least it doesn't have to be combed out as often!

![Lanky](images/R14C2.jpeg)

### Long-Haired

There's not much fluff here, but the fur is very long and silky! It looks a little strange, but in its own way it's very cute and beautiful!

![Long-Haired](images/R14C3.jpeg)

### Classic

The classic, time-tested tail of fox girls with the most balanced balance of fluffiness and length. Very soft and cute, but not too cumbersome.

![Classic](images/R14C4.jpeg)

### Puff

This tail is only knee-length, but it's twice as fluffy as usual! So it's twice as nice to squeeze and harder to hide!

![Puff](images/R14C5.jpeg)

### Royal

Undoubtedly, this tail is the dream of any fox! It's even bigger than your torso, so you can't hope to hide it, but damn, it's so cool! Your foxy friends will howl with envy!

![Royal](images/R14C6.jpeg)

### Epic

Aah! You need the biggest tail! Yeah! Let it be even bigger than you! Ah, it's so nice to hug it! You can even wrap yourself in it like a blanket!

![Epic](images/R14C7.jpeg)

## 



### Banner

A white tip on the tail is the undisputed symbol of foxes, so you'll pay special attention to it to make it the most beautiful. After all, it's what attracts the most attention when you swing your tail!

![Banner](images/R15C1.jpeg)

### Sleek

You can smooth the fur so that the tail becomes much, much thinner for a while. It's a strange feeling, not unpleasant, but you probably won't want to walk around like that for more than a couple of hours.

![Sleek](images/R15C2.jpeg)

### Pattern

You can make your tail stand out by adding some cute spots or even a complex pattern to it. That way, it will look completely unique!

![Pattern](images/R15C3.jpeg)

### Unconventional

Red and white are undoubtedly the best colors for foxes, but sometimes you just want something special... So you're going to paint your fluffy tail in your very own special color!

![Unconventional](images/R15C4.jpeg)

### Spiritual

The tail is not just a piece of flesh, but a thread connecting you to the world of spirits! So if it's a little transparent, it'll be even better!

![Spiritual](images/R15C5.jpeg)

### Demonic

A strange, thin and long tail with a flaming tuft at the end looks so un-foxlike that you could even be mistaken for a demon or a succubus!

![Demonic](images/R15C6.jpeg)

### Flaming

The fur on this tail is not just red, it's flaming! Of course, it's not hot, but anyone will think twice before petting it! It can even glow in the dark if you spend a little mana!

![Flaming](images/R15C7.jpeg)

## Tail Powers



## 



### Mofu Mofu

Your tail is extremely soft and pleasant to the touch. It's literally infused with magic, so it's many times better than any other, even the most exquisite fur, and softer than the softest pillows.

![Mofu Mofu](images/R17C1.jpeg)

### Best Blanket

Foxes have no other blanket than their own tail - but it's more than enough! It's so warm that even if you have to sleep naked in the snow, it's enough to just cover yourself with it!

![Best Blanket](images/R17C2.jpeg)

### Tail Therapy

You can calm down any little fox, child or anyone else by just letting them play with your fluffy little tail for a bit. It's so nice that any worries and anxieties will disappear by themselves!

![Tail Therapy](images/R17C3.jpeg)

### Feint

To confuse your pursuer, just swing your tail in one direction and run in the other! Foxes have been using this trick for thousands of years, but in human form, it works best without clothes on!

![Feint](images/R17C4.jpeg)

### Swipe

If you need to cover your tracks, just don't forget to swing your tail behind you and they'll disappear. There's illusion magic involved here, so no one will be able to track you for hours, even with dogs.

![Swipe](images/R17C5.jpeg)

### Smackdown

If you just slap someone on the head with your tail, they'll go into a blissful daze for a few minutes. This attack is a lot easier than it looks. If you're wearing a skirt, guys are even willing to lean over to make it easier for you!

![Smackdown](images/R17C6.jpeg)

### Censor

The tip of your tail always covers your sensual places by itself. After all, if you tease a guy a little, he'll get even more excited, right?

![Censor](images/R17C7.jpeg)

### Clothing-Friendly

You won't have to make holes in your clothes or mess around with getting your fluffy tail through them. Just dress as usual and it will magically pass through the clothes on its own.

![Clothing-Friendly](images/R17C8.jpeg)

### Danger Sense

Connected to the spirit worlds, your tail will always start to twitch nervously a few minutes before you're in danger. But it doesn't distinguish a finger hit on the corner from an attack by robbers, so watch out!

![Danger Sense](images/R17C9.jpeg)

### Swimming

Few people know this, but the local foxes swim great! Your tail not only doesn't get wet in the water, but it's also very convenient to wag it like a paddle, which makes you swim like a fish.

![Swimming](images/R17C10.jpeg)

### Fox Lights

You can light tiny ghostly lights on the tip of your tail. They can glow right in the air, but they only burn with cold flame if you fill them with magic.

![Fox Lights](images/R17C11.jpeg)

### More Control

You can control the lights even if they are no longer touching your tail. For example, you can make them fly in a certain direction or attach them to something.

![More Control](images/R17C12.jpeg)

### Strong

Your tail is strong enough to support your weight, so you can easily lean on it like a kangaroo! Now you always have a fluffy stool with you, heh.

![Strong](images/R17C13.jpeg)

### Nimble Tail

Your tail is extremely flexible and agile, it's almost like another arm! You can easily grab something with it, and if you train, you can even fight by holding a weapon with it.

![Nimble Tail](images/R17C14.jpeg)

### Shield

Magic gives the fur on your tail extraordinary strength, so you can... No, not use it as a weapon, but gently block blows from almost any cold weapon with it. Even arrows and spears!

![Shield](images/R17C15.jpeg)

### Deflect

Even spells! They just won't explode from the touch of a soft tail, and they won't cause damage, so you can deflect them like a tennis racket! If you're agile enough, you can even throw the spell back at the enemy!

![Deflect](images/R17C16.jpeg)

### Extra Pocket

It seems you can hide something in the fur... Wow, things are sent directly to the spirit world, and you can use more than a cubic meter without feeling any weight! Maybe you can develop this skill even more later?

![Extra Pocket](images/R17C17.jpeg)

### More Tails

You're a kitsune! You should have 9 tails! ...at least a pair? Oh, it seems it's not that easy, and another tail will only grow after 100 years, unless you spend an unimaginable amount of mana on it. But each tail will give you an extra life, just like a cat!

![More Tails](images/R17C18.jpeg)

## Tail Drawbacks



### Unbearably Fluffy

Your tail is too, impossibly pleasant and fluffy! Damn, even you yourself have a hard time making yourself stop stroking and hugging it! Your hands are drawn to it, to enjoy it!

![Unbearably Fluffy](images/R18C1.jpeg)

### Main Target

Your tail is too attractive... So much so that now, even when you're naked, guys will sometimes forget to fuck you and just play with your tail instead!

![Main Target](images/R18C2.jpeg)

### Vulnerability

Your tail does not block damage from maple wood, so an ordinary stick can be more dangerous to you than a sword. Fortunately, different kitsune have vulnerabilities to different types of wood, so you can try to hide this from people.

![Vulnerability](images/R18C3.jpeg)

### Wagging

Your tail always clearly shows all your emotions. Joyfully wagging, nervously tapping on the legs or sticking straight up when you're excited! Even if you concentrate, you won't be able to control it.

![Wagging](images/R18C4.jpeg)

### Frenzy

When you get angry, your tail gets angry too! It will knock things off tables, furiously but very softly hit everyone around, and thump loudly on the floor to show your outrage!

![Frenzy](images/R18C5.jpeg)

### Allergy

As strange as it may sound, but... ACHOO! Looks like your human form has a slight allergy to your own fur! Just wave your tail near your face, and you'll immediately sneeze loudly.

![Allergy](images/R18C6.jpeg)

### Ticklish

Your tail is terribly ticklish, especially the tip! Any touch to it is like the touch of a feather in the hands of an experienced sadist! It's almost impossible to bear, and you want to scratch that spot right away! And it looks like it likes to tickle you!

![Ticklish](images/R18C7.jpeg)

### Thief

Ugh... Your tail loves to mischief and steal all sorts of little shiny things even without your knowledge... especially coins! As soon as you get distracted, it will deftly swipe a few coins, hiding them in your inventory.

![Thief](images/R18C8.jpeg)

### Invitation

Your tail's favorite trick is to lift up your skirt in front of guys who you like, to show them your butt! At any opportunity, it will happily wag, attracting their attention and inviting them to mate with you.

![Invitation](images/R18C9.jpeg)

### Calming Bite

The only way to calm down your mischievous tail is to hold it firmly with your teeth! As soon as you catch it and playfully bite it, it will calm down for at least an hour and behave like a good, sweet tail should.

![Calming Bite](images/R18C10.jpeg)

### Combing

The fur on the tail is very delicate, so it requires at least half an hour of combing and gentle care a day. It's a very pleasant procedure, but if you forget about it, your tail will start to itch terribly and demand to be petted, and your magical power will decrease.

![Combing](images/R18C11.jpeg)

### Wet Fur

The tail quickly gets wet, absorbing water and becoming heavy. This doesn't prevent you from having fun and the fur even looks very beautiful floating in the water, but afterwards you have to wring it out, clean it, dry it, and comb it for a long time.

![Wet Fur](images/R18C12.jpeg)

### Freedom

It will be terribly unpleasant for you to hide your tail, because it is so sensitive and delicate! So free-spirited! Even a heavy skirt will be perceived as an instrument of torture, and you will not even want to think about hiding it in pants.

![Freedom](images/R18C13.jpeg)

### Hungry

When you're hungry, your tail will try to help you by pulling mana out of everything around you. This is very sweet and can support your strength, but it doesn't care at all where or from whom to take mana, even if it's expensive artifacts or magicians who will get very angry!

![Hungry](images/R18C14.jpeg)

### Random Spell

From time to time, your tail can accidentally or mischievously create simple spells like a small illusion or a fox fire. Usually, it's just a funny mishap, but sometimes it can cause trouble, especially if it plays a prank on someone who has power but no sense of humor.

![Random Spell](images/R18C15.jpeg)

### Big and Scary

In case of fear, you always try to fluff up your tail as much as possible and lift it as high as possible! Because this way you look bigger and stronger! Oh, it works quite well with animals, but hissing and waving your tail at people may not be the best idea.

![Big and Scary](images/R18C16.jpeg)

### Instant Loss

As soon as someone grabs you by the tail during a fight, you immediately stop fighting and surrender to the mercy of the winner. You mean, what if they pull too hard or damage it?!

![Instant Loss](images/R18C17.jpeg)

### Weak Spot

The base of the tail is especially sensitive, it's almost an erogenous zone! You always joyfully purr when someone scratch your butt just above the tail, and if it's grabbed during sex, you'll become especially obedient and cum much harder!

![Weak Spot](images/R18C18.jpeg)

##          How can you change your form? <small><small><small><small><span style="color: #AAAAAAAA;">1 or more</span></small></small></small></small>

    

### Full Moon

Like all werewolves, it's easiest for you to change your form under the bright light of a full moon. In fact, it's so easy that you can even accidentally change your body. For example, if you suddenly want to jump forward, but it's easier to do in the form of a fox.

![Full Moon](images/R19C1.jpeg)

### On All Fours

To change your form, you will have to pretend to be a fox and run naked on all fours for some time, preferably in the forest. It takes time, but you won't even notice how suddenly it will become much easier to run. Uff... And as a fox, will you have to walk on your hind legs?

![On All Fours](images/R19C2.jpeg)

### Ritual

You need to perform a short but very silly ritual to transform. The ridiculous song and dance are so bad that you almost burn with shame every time, even if no one is watching. Or is the shame the real condition? Oh, in any case, you don't even want to think about what you'll have to do in the form of a fox...

![Ritual](images/R19C3.jpeg)

### Graveyards

Kitsune have been using the power of ancient burials, catacombs, and mausoleums since ancient times... Emnn... No-no-no, you don't need a shovel! You don't need to dig or scrape with your paws! It's enough just to come here, because the boundary between the worlds there is much thinner than usual!

![Graveyards](images/R19C4.jpeg)

### Sister's Help

It's much easier to transform when another kitsune helps you. Even if you forget how to do it for some reason - just go to any of the hidden temples or find one of your sisters in town by scent, and they will easily make you human again. All you need is one little kiss!

![Sister's Help](images/R19C5.jpeg)

### Spirit World

At any moment, you can enter the spirit world, change your form there, and come back to the real world. It won't take even a second, but you'll spend a lot of mana, so in your new body, you'll be very tired, unless you specifically save energy for the transformation.

![Spirit World](images/R19C6.jpeg)

### Just a Fox

First of all, you're still a fox! So, when you run out of mana, you get hungry or very, very tired, you'll immediately return to your familiar and comfortable animal form. Being human is actually damn hard, so a little rest in the forest will definitely help you.

![Just a Fox](images/R19C7.jpeg)

### Next



![Next]()

##  


You were afraid it was all a dream, but when you came out of the spirit world, you found yourself in the forest in your new body. Naked and beautiful, you spun around for almost half an hour, looking at and touching yourself, wagging your tail, yapping in delight barely able to keep from jumping up and down with crazy joy! You're so beautiful! So cute! And you... you're human again! Every sensation in your new body caused a storm of delight, and thoughts of how you would go to people made your heart race so much that you had to force yourself to stay in the forest for a little longer.

You've long stashed away a few stolen coin purses and gold trinkets you found in the ruins, knowing that they would come in handy someday. And now that time had come! But digging through the earth with thin delicate fingers is so awkward... 

Oh! Realizing that now you don't have to dig the ground with your hands, you laughed and sat down on the grass with your bare ass. It's the hands! You can use tools again! Haha, you're so out of it! Grabbing a stick, you quickly dug out your stash, took a bunch of coins and rushed to the nearest tavern. Humans! Haha! You're human too! Hello! Oh, why are they staring at you like that? Don't they like your tail? But it's so cute, isn't it? Mmm... And why do some guys start to smell so delicious and attractive... What is this strange feeling of hunger, you just ate a rabbit...?  

Oh! Clothes!!! You're completely naked! And the guys near the tavern are already clearly bulging in their pants! And for some reason, you feel like it's exactly what can satisfy your hunger... Ah, yes, the foxes said that semen is the best source of magical energy for kitsune. A hundred times better than regular food or rest in the forest... And you must have spent a lot of mana to create a body for yourself! That's why you're so hungry!

Nervously wagging your tail a couple of times, you smiled uncertainly at them, torn between the desire to cover your bare breasts and to rip off their pants.  From excitement and hunger, you completely forgot what to do in such situations! Apologize? Show them your den first? Get down on your knees and whine for a quick feed? Wait until they treat you to beer and invite you to dance? Just in case, you raised your tail higher - an inviting signal understood by any fox! And when one of them put his hand on your soft butt, you realized that people also understand it very well... 

...and that very soon you will be well fed~ 

##  


The guys quickly take you to their room in the tavern, where they "feed" you for several hours in a row, until they are completely exhausted and fall asleep without even pulling their dicks out of your holes. Hmm... Is that normal for guys? You mean, it seems like they didn't just fall asleep, but lost consciousness, so they don't react at all no matter how hard you shake them and ask for more... Anyway, you yourself feel full of energy and ready to keep on fucking all day long! Or two! 

With a contented sigh, you gently pat your pubis, warmed by the mana that has filled you, and finally let the softening cocks slip out of you. Not a single drop of cum leaked out, but just in case, you licked the dicks clean and covered the unconscious bodies with a blanket, so no one would suspect anything.

Clothes, you definitely need clothes... You don't really plan to fuck non-stop all the time, do you? Sometimes you'll just have to walk around the city... Oh, if you rip off these rough pants, you'll get great shorts! And this T-shirt... Ugh, if only it was a little smaller...

Suddenly, you felt a surge of energy through your hands, and an illusion enveloped the fabric, making it light and semi-transparent. Hahaha! Magic! Right! You are a Kitsune after all! Ahaha! This is so cool!

Quickly pulling on the T-shirt, which felt much bigger than it looked, you turned to the mirror, once again enchanted by your own beauty. In your past life, you would have given anything for just one night with such beauty! Ah, and that tail! And ears! You are perfection! Not a single flaw, every strand of hair is laid out to accentuate your enchanting beauty! As if magic created this body exactly according to your ideas of beauty... Well, that's probably what it was! And all those countless images of top models, vibrant hentai, and the finest art you've seen in your past life have allowed you to create a true masterpiece!

 

Hmm... By the way, why does this feel so familiar? As if you've stood in front of a mirror like this before, holding a cursed... Ugh... Cursed mirror? Diary? Painting? Oh... It seems to have glowed... Damn, sometimes these memories are so fuzzy...

Oh! By the way, you're human now! You mean you shouldn't be yapping with joy, right? Even though your body has changed and you think more clearly now, sometimes you still act just like a fox! This... is it cute? Or not? Ugh... you have to figure this out while the boys are asleep and you have free time!

## Mind Features



### Animal Language

Of course, even in human form, you'll still be able to communicate with foxes. It's not convenient to yapping now, and you'll have a strange accent, but that's no reason to stop contacting your friends, is it?

![Animal Language](images/R24C1.jpeg)

### Old Friends

Actually, foxes still seem smarter to you than many people. Maybe in this world they really are smarter? Or have you just gotten used to them? In any case, you'll often prefer to communicate or ask for advice from old friends, rather than from people.

![Old Friends](images/R24C2.jpeg)

### Sisterhood

Foxes are amazingly friendly creatures, and you'll always do whatever it takes to help any of your sisters, just as they would for you. Even if it means that you'll have to drop everything and run away together with her.

![Sisterhood](images/R24C3.jpeg)

### Respect

The more tails, the older the kitsune, and the more you'll respect her. In turn, all ordinary foxes will consider you an older sister and be obedient to you. But of course, you'll take care of your little sisters!

![Respect](images/R24C4.jpeg)

### Liar

Kitsune are known for their cunning, so you're also great at lying and deceiving gullible people. For you, this is completely natural, and you'll never get confused in your lies.

![Liar](images/R24C5.jpeg)

### Smell of Lies

Huhu~, stupid, ignorant people think they can fool a fox! You see all their pitiful tricks in advance and can literally sniff out a lie even in a sealed letter!

![Smell of Lies](images/R24C6.jpeg)

### Compulsive Liar

Lying is so easy and simple that sometimes you make up tall tales and lies just like that, out of habit! Even if it would be easier to tell the truth, you can still lie without even thinking about it.

![Compulsive Liar](images/R24C7.jpeg)

### Smart

Foxes are certainly more intelligent than ordinary people! At least you - you're definitely smarter! Or is it all because of your old soul and knowledge? It doesn't matter, you're still incredibly clever and can easily argue even with recognized sages!

![Smart](images/R24C8.jpeg)

### Fast Learner

Your learning speed is incredible! In the past, you probably could have finished university in just a year or so! But you often rush and get very nervous when you don't understand something, which makes you look like a funny, excited nerd.

![Fast Learner](images/R24C9.jpeg)

### Slave

Your talent can play tricks on you, because you're also very easy to train to be a slave. It is enough to whip your ass just a few times as punishment and you will learn this lesson and from then on you will always swallow cock exactly as your master wants you to. 

![Slave](images/R24C10.jpeg)

### Inventor

If you try to solve a particularly difficult problem for several days in a row, then you're sure to have an epiphany and understand what you need to do! It's probably just fragments of memories from a past life, or maybe you really are a genius!

![Inventor](images/R24C11.jpeg)

### Scientist

You haven't remembered your past life in all the details, but you definitely remember what science is and how research should be organized. So, if you start seriously researching something, you'll achieve incredible success!

![Scientist](images/R24C12.jpeg)

### Tactic

You have excellent tactical thinking and can easily calculate the situation and opponent's behavior ten steps ahead, so military strategy is just as easy for you as any games. You can immediately be at the level of the greatest players, even in new games.

![Tactic](images/R24C13.jpeg)

### Baka

The sad truth is that although you undoubtedly have some talents, in ordinary life, you're a rather simple and naive girl. Uhh... some even call you a fool... But at least you have a beautiful ass, and that's the most important thing!

![Baka](images/R24C14.jpeg)

### Seducer

You know exactly what guys like and what they want~ So, you can masterfully use your beautiful, hot body to seduce almost anyone! Even faithful husbands and monks will have a hell of a time resisting if you try hard enough!

![Seducer](images/R24C15.jpeg)

### Sixth Sense

Kitsune sense other people's lust with a special sense, almost like succubi, so you'll always know exactly what a guy is willing to do for a night with you. Will the guard let you go for a blowjob, or will you have to do your best to please him and all his friends all night long?

![Sixth Sense](images/R24C16.jpeg)

### Submissive

You're pretty damn submissive, especially when it comes to sex. However, even in everyday life, you'll have a hard time resisting truly dominant figures. It's so pleasant and attractive to serve them, to let them take advantage of you...

![Submissive](images/R24C17.jpeg)

### Support

Supporting everyone around you is as natural for you as breathing, so you are always ready to praise someone or help a little to make them feel better. And that's right, because when everyone is happy, you are happy too!

![Support](images/R24C18.jpeg)

### Dominant

You like to look from top to bottom and be in control, so even if you're the one receiving, you'll still try to control the banging process! Ha, even if you get caught by bandits in the woods you'd still prefer to get mounted on their cocks yourself!

![Dominant](images/R24C19.jpeg)

### Rude

You're a damn rude and misbehaving girl. You don't have any authority among people, and you find the norms of behavior completely stupid, so you do whatever you want, even in a palace or something.

![Rude](images/R24C20.jpeg)

### Vindictive

You have a very good memory and you perfectly remember all the offenses you have suffered! And you will avenge each and every one of them... Twice! Even if you can do it only after many years, you will enjoy this moment of revenge!

![Vindictive](images/R24C21.jpeg)

### Favorable

You are very favorable to those who honor you, give you gifts and serve you. It is enough for someone to simply leave you some tasty meat on the fox altar, and in case of trouble, you will try to warn them in advance or help them by returning the favor. After all, someone has to take care of you!

![Favorable](images/R24C22.jpeg)

### Really Grateful

Sometimes you're so grateful that you sneak out to men's houses at night to thank them properly for the gift! Oh, no, that's not prostitution! They don't know in advance how you're gonna reward them, so it doesn't count, right?

![Really Grateful](images/R24C23.jpeg)

### Holding

Even though you have human hands now, you still have the habit of carrying objects in your mouth... Well, you mean, it's still handy, isn't it? Why do people look at you so weird on the street?

![Holding](images/R24C24.jpeg)

### Language Barrier

Oh... You may have become a kitsune and are almost human instead of a fox, but... You don't understand the local language! Looks like you're going to have to make a serious effort to find a teacher so you can actually talk to someone!

![Language Barrier](images/R24C25.jpeg)

### Kyute Talk

You have a very strange accent, you sometimes habitually whine and yap like a fox, and you end almost every sentence with the particle "Kyu~". It sounds so cute that people often ask you to tell them something just to enjoy your voice. 

![Kyute Talk](images/R24C26.jpeg)

### Amorous

The people are so wonderful, you're bound to fall in love with someone once you're in town! And probably several men at once! Then you will find more and more beloved ones! Pure, uncontaminated love with the brightest emotions is guaranteed for you!

![Amorous](images/R24C27.jpeg)

### Yandere

You fall in love so wildly and ruthlessly that sometimes it's really dangerous for everyone around you! You are ready to sweep away any obstacles that stand in the way of your love, to commit any crime! If you have to, you will even chase away his girlfriend threatening with a knife or kidnap your lover!

![Yandere](images/R24C28.jpeg)

### Tamed

When you are in fox form, you can befriend some human very easily. They may think they have tamed you and are happy to have a beautiful pet, but in fact it is you who will tame them and make them feed and pamper you and comb out your tail!

![Tamed](images/R24C29.jpeg)

### Caring Mom

You have incredibly strong maternal instincts and you just adore children! Any children! You will take care of, protect, and pamper them all, even if they are of another race, and you will happily spend days and even weeks on it.

![Caring Mom](images/R24C30.jpeg)

### Crybaby

You always react very emotionally to any situation and often cry even over minor things. All it takes is for you to remember something that happened a few years ago and you'll start crying.

![Crybaby](images/R24C31.jpeg)

### Licking

You still have the habit of licking ravenously when you see something tasty. But now it's not only food, but also appetizing men and tasty cocks that you want to lick! Some inexperienced guys at the bar literally shudder with their whole body when you do that, looking at their pants!

### Tasty Chickens

In the past, it was very difficult for you to catch delicious birds, and you rarely had the chance to enjoy their taste... So now they are definitely your favorite dish! Chickens, geese, turkeys! Roasted, boiled, smoked, stewed! Stuffed with mushrooms and apples! Ah, what a delicacy!

![Tasty Chickens](images/R24C33.jpeg)

### Fresh

Fried meat is very delicious, but... At least once a week, you always treat yourself to a piece of juicy, raw, still warm and dripping with blood meat! You are even willing to tear the prey apart with your bare hands, sink your teeth into its tender, quivering flesh that literally melts in your mouth!

![Fresh](images/R24C34.jpeg)

### Kitsugami Loves Apples

Fragrant apples have always been your weakness and even as a fox, you loved to sneak into gardens just to bite into that sour, juicy and sweet fruit! Of course, you won't refuse this delicacy now that you can simply buy it!

![Kitsugami Loves Apples](images/R24C35.jpeg)

### Child at Heart

You are playful like a child, no, even like two children! Your energy is limitless and you are ready to play for hours, and your curiosity and mischief never leave you, so often your good mood becomes a problem for those around you! But you are so cute that usually you are willingly forgiven.

![Child at Heart](images/R24C36.jpeg)

### Thrill of the Steal

You have always enjoyed teasing people as a fox. Sneaking up, stealing a little meat right from the table in front of everyone, and then running away amidst the general outcry is so thrilling! Ha, it's so much fun that you're sure you won't be able to resist occasionally playing pranks in the city!

![Thrill of the Steal](images/R24C37.jpeg)

### Naughty Fox

You really have no idea when to stop. Your pranks, jokes, and games never stop for a minute and even if they ask you to stop and beg for mercy, you can only hold out for a maximum of a few hours before pulling off another prank!

![Naughty Fox](images/R24C38.jpeg)

### Adventurer

You have so much unstoppable energy, curiosity, and thirst for risk that anyone who gets to know you for just a few hours will say that you are a born adventurer. Ah, endless adventures, new cities and lands, mysterious catacombs and treasures... This is what life is all about!

![Adventurer](images/R24C39.jpeg)

### Housewife

In fact, you really like peace and quiet. A calm and predictable daily routine, chatting with neighbors about all sorts of nonsense, delicious home-cooked food, taking care of a loved one... It may not be the stuff of legends, but isn't that what it means to 'enjoy life'?

![Housewife](images/R24C40.jpeg)

### Shiny Jewelry

You love all kinds of shiny, glittering jewelry so much that you always wear them in enormous amounts. Way too much! So many, that often even the most exquisite and expensive jewelry starts to look tasteless and cheap.

![Shiny Jewelry](images/R24C41.jpeg)

### Savage

You have become so accustomed to the wild life in the forest that you still consider the savage style of clothing and jewelry to be the most comfortable and beautiful. You may not be the most refined lady, but you are definitely a hot, wild thing!

![Savage](images/R24C42.jpeg)

###  Litter Tray

After many years in a fox's body, you have become too accustomed to going without a toilet... And even if you force yourself to sit on it, your tail will still be in the way. So if you don't plan to go outside, you'll have to set up a litter box at home, just like you would for a pet.

![ Litter Tray](images/R24C43.jpeg)

### Scratching

You are quite flexible and agile, and old habits die hard, so sometimes, when lost in thought, you'll scratch behind your ear with your hind paw. Oh, you mean your foot! Of course you wouldn't do it in dirty, rough boots, but at home - why not?

![Scratching](images/R24C44.jpeg)

### Proper Lady

You are one of those foxes who values tradition and etiquette above all else. You always behave so impeccably that you look a bit old-fashioned, like a courtly lady from ancient times.

![Proper Lady](images/R24C45.jpeg)

### Lazy

Ugh... The human body and life in the city is so relaxing... no longer having to catch your own breakfast every morning and being able to just lounge around in bed... Ah, how you've missed this slow, lazy life! It was worth returning to the humans just for this!

![Lazy](images/R24C46.jpeg)

### Messy

You've long since forgotten what it means to own things, clean your rooms, and put things in order, so now your clothes are often lying around and any place you live is quickly in disarray unless someone else cleans it.

![Messy](images/R24C47.jpeg)

### Sloppy

You're especially sloppy during blowjobs, so saliva doesn't just cover your face and breasts, but even flies in all directions! You have to clean it up afterwards, but hey, guys never complain about it! On the contrary, they seem to really enjoy how wildly and self-indulgently you're gagging on their cocks!

![Sloppy](images/R24C48.jpeg)

### Bad Habits

It turns out that some bad habits can survive even reincarnation... So as soon as you returned to the city, you became addicted again to sweet candies, fatty salty chips, and alcohol. Sometimes you anxiously sniff around, afraid that the next merchant is selling tobacco...

![Bad Habits](images/R24C49.jpeg)

### Bitey

Fox instincts are very strong and you will still reflexively bite anyone who tries to scratch your tummy without permission! Or who is just not careful or lucky enough to be near you when you're in a playful mood! Of course, you don't bite with all your strength, but they're sure to have marks left!

![Bitey](images/R24C50.jpeg)

### Shy

Oh, no, how could you forget that? Humans have so little fur! Without clothes, they're naked! And you're so used to your warm fur! Eh, now you're always covering your arms in shame and you feel especially vulnerable when you're naked in front of someone, even if you're planning to have a wild orgy. 

![Shy](images/R24C51.jpeg)

### Nudist

Clothing is such a silly thing! Foxes live perfectly fine without it! So you prefer to walk around naked, exposing yourself at every opportunity. At home, on the beach, in a camp deep in the forest - anywhere where it won't harm you, you'll be walking around in your natural state, not worrying about who might see you.

![Nudist](images/R24C52.jpeg)

### Your Color

You loved the color of your cute fur so much that you will always choose clothes only to match your hair and tail. White, red, or black - it must be just like you and what you're used to! Besides, it looks quite cute!

![Your Color](images/R24C53.jpeg)

### Fear of Heights

You've become so accustomed to the ground being right there that you're terribly afraid of heights! Even if someone tall just picks you up, you can scream in fear!

![Fear of Heights](images/R24C54.jpeg)

### Phobia

Cucumbers give you almost inexplicable, panic attacks. All it takes is for you to notice a single, innocent-looking cucumber, and you'll jump to the side with a frightened shriek and try to grab a weapon to deal with the green threat as quickly as possible!

![Phobia](images/R24C55.jpeg)

### Boxes

Maybe you're not a cat, but boxes are just too convenient and cozy! You simply can't pass by such a wonderful shelter without hiding in it for at least a few seconds! And how great it is to suddenly jump out of them on unsuspecting victims!

![Boxes](images/R24C56.jpeg)

### Snoot Challenge

You know it's damn stupid, but if someone holds out their hands and calls you, you'll probably not be able to resist the urge to try to stick your sharp snout between their hands. Oops, you mean face!

![Snoot Challenge](images/R24C57.jpeg)

### Slutty

Yeah! You finally have a hot feminine body! Somehow you seem to have dreamed of it even in your past life... So you immediately bought the sluttiest suit, sure to enjoy the depraved life and the lustful gazes of the men who are already raping you in their dreams!

![Slutty](images/R24C58.jpeg)

### Treasure

You won't let anyone pet your tail just like that! All that fluffiness is for you alone! Only you can enjoy it!... Oh, alright, the most they can hope for is to grab you by the tail during hot sex! But nothing more!

![Treasure](images/R24C59.jpeg)

### Bad Pretender

You're awfully bad at pretending that you don't like being taken by force or threatened with rape. It's an unthinkably obvious lie, which nevertheless every single person plays along with! Even the thugs will continue to threaten you even while laughing at your lustful appearance. 

![Bad Pretender](images/R24C60.jpeg)

### Always Yes

Foxes never turn down a good snack, and you'd have to be a complete idiot to turn down an offer of quick sex! Just a quickie to fill you with energy! As soon as someone mentions it, you'll gladly lower your panties... Was that a joke? Hey, stop staring, get out your dick and get to work!

![Always Yes](images/R24C61.jpeg)

### Tail Fights

Sometimes even foxes argue, but you will definitely never fight seriously, to the point of blood! A battle of tails - that's what can settle any dispute! Standing butt to butt and slapping each other until one gives up! Yes, that's exactly how all conflicts should be resolved!  

![Tail Fights](images/R24C62.jpeg)

### Foxes Best

Sex with other kitsune won't give you any mana, but... You just love your little sisters! It's pure pleasure, unmarred by thoughts of food and energy! Ah, their bodies are so hot, and they're so skilled that every encounter ends in a wild fuck that leaves you with a blissful smile on your face for several days.

![Foxes Best](images/R24C63.jpeg)

### Full Tank

You're greedy as hell and always demanding to be cum-filled in every hole! That way the mana is absorbed faster! And anyway, who fucks girls only once and only in the pussy? You need to be filled properly and you won't let go of a guy until he's treated you to his hot cum at least a couple times!

![Full Tank](images/R24C64.jpeg)

### Sharing

Kitsune love to share their catch with their sisters and have FFM threesomes, so you'll often be invited to join in the fun, and you'll also try to share the goodies at the first opportunity! After all, licking dicks together with a friend is twice as much fun!

![Sharing](images/R24C65.jpeg)

### Anyone

All guys are attractive enough for you. As long as they are healthy, strong and have dicks, what's the problem? The fact that they are several times older than you or on the contrary young and naive doesn't matter to you at all as long as they can fuck you good!

![Anyone](images/R24C66.jpeg)

### Big Dick Lover

Huge, monstrous dicks that were unimaginable in your past world have become your true passion. You're ready to worship, lick, and please them as much as you can! It's so insanely pleasurable for you that you're even willing to pay males with the biggest dicks for sex and food!

![Big Dick Lover](images/R24C67.jpeg)

### Weakness to Knots

You've tried the forbidden fruit and now you prefer knotted dicks over any other. The feeling of it swelling inside your pussy is the best in the world! It even seems to you that your body is literally made for them, and your pussy is perfectly adapted to them.

![Weakness to Knots](images/R24C68.jpeg)

### Werewolf's Meat

Huge, powerful, rough, and incredibly dominant, werewolves seem like the perfect sex partners for you. Their scent turns you on so much that when you met a wolf-shifter for the first time, you almost came just from that! And you're ready to come every second while their dick is in you!

![Werewolf's Meat](images/R24C69.jpeg)

### Tail Job

Your tail is very sensitive, so not only do you tease and tickle guys during sex, but you also love to jerk them off with it! And since semen is completely absorbed into your fur, you don't have to worry about cleaning it up!

![Tail Job](images/R24C70.jpeg)

### Nine-Tailed

You want a second tail so badly that you often wear an ass plug with an artificial one. Or two. Or three! Sure, the other kitsune will laugh and tease you, but... Eh... It's worth it! It'll make you feel like a great fox, at least for a while! 

![Nine-Tailed](images/R24C71.jpeg)

### Unfaithful

You'll never be able to be a faithful wife and live with just one partner. You simply need different dicks and liters of semen inside you! Oh, you... The most you can promise is that you'll just use guys as sex toys and won't even look at their faces!

![Unfaithful](images/R24C72.jpeg)

### Dining Etiquette

When you have sex for mana, you behave extremely professionally. A man's pleasure is always your top priority, so much so that you wouldn't dare touch yourself or come without his permission.

![Dining Etiquette](images/R24C73.jpeg)

### Reverse Rape

Men and their energy are just prey to you and you behave like a true predator! Sometimes you literally hunt them, stalking this delicious prey for hours to make a decisive attack and mercilessly drain their balls!

![Reverse Rape](images/R24C74.jpeg)

### Doggy Style

You've become too accustomed to it when you were a fox, so now, in order to fully surrender to passion and not think about anything but the hot dick in your wet pussy, you prefer to stand firmly on all fours.

![Doggy Style](images/R24C75.jpeg)

### Pinned Down

You prefer it when a guy pins you down to the bed with his weight, completely controlling you. And it's even better if he bites you hard on the scruff of the neck or at least puts his paw on your head, so you can only moan into the pillow, coming over and over again!

![Pinned Down](images/R24C76.jpeg)

### Free Use

You're totally open to the fact that anyone can just walk up and fuck you anytime they want. You'll be only grateful that they'll share their energy! And it's even better if they do it all themselves, without distracting you too much while they fill you with cum.

![Free Use](images/R24C77.jpeg)

## Body Features



### Perfect

You're not just beautiful, you're perfection, the ideal that legends will be written about and that artists and sculptors will vainly try to capture! Oh, it seems that you're subconsciously creating an illusion based on the desires of whoever's looking at you...

![Perfect](images/R25C1.jpeg)

### Cute

You're one of the cutest creatures in this world, like a concentrate of cuteness from a hundred younger sisters. Even other kitsune consider you something special and squeal with delight whenever they have a chance to pet you, hug you, or bury their faces in your fluffy tail!

![Cute](images/R25C2.jpeg)

### Curly

It's a bit unusual for a kitsune, but you're a very curly fox. All your fur and hair softly curls, making it look twice as fluffy. Of course you'll have to comb it out even more thoroughly, but you look really unique and eye-catching!

![Curly](images/R25C3.jpeg)

### Antenna

You will always have one strand of hair on your head that sticks up almost vertically. No matter how hard you try to smooth it out, it will stick up proudly again in just half an hour. It's funny, but sometimes you think it even reflects your mood. It sags a bit when you're sad and sticks out especially cheerfully when you're having fun. 

![Antenna](images/R25C4.jpeg)

### Supernatural

Even if you cast illusions or other magic on yourself, there will always be something inhuman about your appearance. Vertical pupils, overly sharp fangs, fox whiskers or their pattern on your face... Anyone who talks to you for even ten minutes will almost certainly notice it.

![Supernatural](images/R25C5.jpeg)

### Paws

Transformation is a complicated and intricate process and sometimes things go wrong. So every now and then you can end up with almost animal paws instead of hands for a day or two... They're also very cute in their own way, and they're as agile as your fingers, but they still look pretty weird. 

![Paws](images/R25C6.jpeg)

### Fur Collar

On your chest, there will be a noticeable furry collar made of thick and warm fur. While you're clothed, it's easy to pretend that it's just an accessory, but when you're naked, it's clear that it's your own fur. During transformation, you can try to hide it, but over time, it will reappear.

![Fur Collar](images/R25C7.jpeg)

### Freckles

While you were a fox, you didn't notice it, but now, without fur, it's clear that your skin is very delicate and sensitive to the sun. Cute freckles adorn your face, chest, back, and even your butt, and if you spend a lot of time in the sun, they'll become even more noticeable! Huh, at least magical creatures don't have to worry about cancer.

![Freckles](images/R25C8.jpeg)

### Blizzard-Proof

Foxes are perfectly adapted to life in the wild, so you've never been cold before and can ignore the weather now. The main thing is that you should be fed and full of energy, and then you can even run naked during a blizzard, playing with snowflakes and not noticing the frost!

![Blizzard-Proof](images/R25C9.jpeg)

### Shiverer

Urff... You're so used to always having warm, fluffy fur that you're noticeably cold without it. Luckily people invented winter clothing a long time ago, so you just need to wrap up warm and you'll be fine. Two or three sweaters, a few scarves, and a heavy winter coat will be just right for a little walk... in the fall!

![Shiverer](images/R25C10.jpeg)

### Barefoot

Clothes are fine, but shoes... No way! You have to feel the ground with your paws! Every leaf, every pebble and blade of grass! This feeling is so important to you that you hate shoes and wear them only in extreme cases, preferring to go everywhere barefoot. 

![Barefoot](images/R25C11.jpeg)

### Active

As long as you are eating well, you are always full of energy and enthusiasm. You love nothing more than to move and be active, and you hardly ever get tired. In fact, you almost always prefer to run and enjoy the rush rather than take a slow walks.

![Active](images/R25C12.jpeg)

### Hidden Power

Heh, while foxes look cute, they are predators! Fast, strong and agile! So even in a cute girl's body, you're still pretty strong and tough! Well... you're no Hercules, but you can lift a two hundred pounds and run with it. You're probably even a stronger than elite warrior men. 

![Hidden Power](images/R25C13.jpeg)

### Tough

You're pretty tough, and your body can easily tolerate even prolonged exertion and cramped positions. Strange why the first thing that came to your mind was long hours in tight bondage? Hmm... But yeah, you could probably easily spend hours or even days in the ropes without any consequences or pain.

![Tough](images/R25C14.jpeg)

### Fangs

You have very noticeable, sharp, and strong fangs that are very convenient for biting. However, everyone knows that kitsune are not capable of biting off a dick, so it's unlikely that anyone will be afraid to fuck you in the mouth... And don't even dare think about actually biting even the worst rapist! Don't ruin the legend that your sisters have been creating for thousands of years!

![Fangs](images/R25C15.jpeg)

### Claws

You have strong and durable claws on your fingers that magically hide in your nails. You can extend them in a fraction of a second to firmly grab onto something, open an envelope, or scratch a message into a tree... Hey, you're not planning on fighting with them, are you? They're just little claws, not daggers!

![Claws](images/R25C16.jpeg)

### Enchanted

In case of danger or when you're angry, your fangs and claws are enveloped in magic, so they become truly dangerous. So, if you get angry enough, you'll be able to tear a steel breastplate with your claws as if it's made of cardboard! Or climb up a sheer cliff, leaving scary, jagged marks on the rock.

![Enchanted](images/R25C17.jpeg)

### Flexible

By human standards, you're quite flexible, as you can easily do the splits, scratch your ear with your foot, or fold in half to lick your pussy... But you yourself bitterly remember your fox body, which is much more agile and nimble! However, now your arms are much longer and you have fingers, so there are advantages to the human form!

![Flexible](images/R25C18.jpeg)

### Quick as a Fox

You spent years running on four paws and learned to do it so well that you can still run faster than on two legs. Ha! That's funny, but you can actually outrun a trained sprinter! You'd probably greatly surprise the Olympic Committee by setting several new records running on all fours!

![Quick as a Fox](images/R25C19.jpeg)

### Jumpy

Foxes are excellent jumpers, so even now you can easily jump up two or three times your height from your seat. This can be enough to jump over a fence or even on the roof of a house. Also, you are not afraid of falling even from the fifth floor, just land on your paws and you'll be fine!

![Jumpy](images/R25C20.jpeg)

### Dodging

Sharp fox instincts and a nimble body will allow you to dodge even the fastest attacks. Just trust them! It may look like the panicked, chaotic movements of a novice, but it is so fast that even if someone shoots several arrows at you at once - you will dodge them all. Even if you can't see the attackers!

![Dodging](images/R25C21.jpeg)

### Practice Makes Purr-fect

Oh, turns out all you needed was to spend some time in a human body and refresh your memories! Fox paws are actually quite nimble, and now you can easily control them almost like hands! Ha, with a little practice, you might even be able to write in fox form!

![Practice Makes Purr-fect](images/R25C22.jpeg)

### Sentient

Just prepare your clothes and adapt some weapons and tools beforehand, and you will be able to travel like an intelligent fox. Of course, you won't be able to pronounce some sounds, but you will still be able to communicate, so no one will mistake you for a wild fox and treat you as a sentient being.

![Sentient](images/R25C23.jpeg)

### Fighting Instincts

You're not sure if this is a result of the transformation or if it has anything to do with fox magic. It seems more like it's a part of your memories from your past life, but either way, you're really good at fighting. Maybe you were an athlete? Either way, brawling feels familiar to you, and blood doesn't scare you.

![Fighting Instincts](images/R25C24.jpeg)

### Sword Master

Swords, halberds, even bows and some exotic types of melee weapons feel so familiar and comfortable to you... You can't remember if you've fought seriously before or just practiced, but your hands clearly remember how to hold a weapon, and armor doesn't hinder your movements.

![Sword Master](images/R25C25.jpeg)

### Bloodlust

Your predator instincts have strangely mixed with your skills, so when you give in to rage, you start moving even faster, hitting even harder, fighting like a bloodthirsty demon! But you can't control yourself and revel in the battle until you've massacred all enemies in the most brutal way possible.

![Bloodlust](images/R25C26.jpeg)

### Tactical Fox

Swords seem like toys to you, and in case of danger, your hands automatically reach for your waist, as if hoping to find a familiar holster there. You're convinced that if you get your hands on some real firearms, even demons will cry bloody tears... It's just that it looks like you'll have to create this weapon yourself.

![Tactical Fox](images/R25C27.jpeg)

### Nights Hunter

Not only do you have sharp eyesight, but you also see perfectly in the dark. The moonlight is enough for you to be able to read books or do any other activities. Also, your eyes noticeably glow in the dark, like a cat's... or a werewolf's.

![Nights Hunter](images/R25C28.jpeg)

### Arcane Vision

When you infuse your eyes with some mana, you begin to see the streams of magic and energy that permeate the world. It seems that even great wizards can't see it as clearly as you can, so all the magic traps and hiding places will shine like fairy lights for you, because no one is hiding them!

![Arcane Vision](images/R25C29.jpeg)

### Whiskers

The fox whiskers are still with you! You can hide them so that they are just a cute mark on your cheeks, but when you spread them out, the world is filled with the feeling of vibrations again! Humans have no idea what it is, so it's hard to describe in words, but you can navigate even in total darkness and feel someone's breath three dozen paces away.

![Whiskers](images/R25C30.jpeg)

### Scent

Smell is the most important sense for foxes, so even though you've changed your body into a human one, you still sense scents a thousand times stronger than normal humans. Following a trail is no more difficult than if it were painted with glowing paint, and the male hormones are so attractive that they literally make your head spin!

![Scent](images/R25C31.jpeg)

### Scent-suality

When you meet a person, you always try to sniff them. A pleasant smell is even more important to you than looks! And if you see a really attractive ass, you'll find it incredibly hard to resist sniffing it immediately in public. But hey, you're a well-behaved fox. Of course, you'll ask permission first!

![Scent-suality](images/R25C32.jpeg)

### Drunkard

You love alcohol. It actually contains more mana than regular food, so it's actually good for you and it actually gives you some energy. You don't get a hangover and all that... But at the same time, you get drunk just as fast as any other little cute girl - almost instantly!

![Drunkard](images/R25C33.jpeg)

### Intoxicated Lust

When you get drunk, you get horny like you're in heat and you almost lose control. Drunk, available and obedient, ready to pull your tail up in front of anyone and eager to suck any cock... In the morning you'll probably wake up with strangers, stuffed to the brim!

![Intoxicated Lust](images/R25C34.jpeg)

### Gourmet

You sense taste much more subtly than any gourmet, so you are able to enjoy delicious food much more! Juicy aromatic broths, roasted meat, cutlets, barbecue, soups with sausages... Ha ha, it looks like you definitely won't be a vegetarian, since all that meat is so delicious!

![Gourmet](images/R25C35.jpeg)

### Sweet Tooth

The cakes may not have your favorite meat in them, but they are so sweet! So insanely delicious! Buttercream, berries, chocolate! Ah, it looks like you have become a real sweet tooth, because you are ready to eat only sweets and candies day after day!

![Sweet Tooth](images/R25C36.jpeg)

### High Metabolism

Huh, looks like no matter how much yummy stuff you eat, you're in no danger of becoming obese! Everything just turns into pure energy, so you don't even suffer from overeating! Huh, you don't even have to use the toilet! 

![High Metabolism](images/R25C37.jpeg)

### Licker

Mmm... Actually, humans have such an interesting taste~ Oh no, you're not going to actually eat them! Just a little lick to savor the flavor! Juicy asses and soft breasts are especially good!

![Licker](images/R25C38.jpeg)

### Rough Tongue

You still have a very rough tongue, and you lick in a fox-like way, fast and strong, so when you selflessly enjoy tasty pussy, a girl is guaranteed to have at least several orgasms!

![Rough Tongue](images/R25C39.jpeg)

### Tongue-Twister

You must have messed something up when you created your body, but now you can extend your tongue about 10 inches! It's almost like a small but very nimble tentacle, it's weird that it doesn't interfere with your normal life at all!

![Tongue-Twister](images/R25C40.jpeg)

### Mana Tanks

Your body is an embodied dream, so by controlling the mana flows you can change the size of your breasts to always look your best. And the bigger your boobs are, the more mana you can store in them!

![Mana Tanks](images/R25C41.jpeg)

### Burden

Damn tits are like they're mocking you, always a little too big! Just enough that you have to struggle with them for a few seconds every time you get dressed! But then it's like they shrink again, so you can't pick out roomier clothes!

![Burden](images/R25C42.jpeg)

### Milky Fox

Your breasts produce a liter of milk every day. You can control the taste and, more importantly, the mana saturation of the milk, practically turning it into a mana potion. But... Milking yourself is so wrong! Every time, you'll be eager to find someone to suck the milk or milk you.

![Milky Fox](images/R25C43.jpeg)

### Self-Sustenance

Uh-oh. Your milk always seems to be full of magic! Damn, your stupid breasts are using up your reserves and you can't stop it! So to get your mana back, you'll have to suck your own breasts, drinking at least a couple glasses of your milk a day. 

![Self-Sustenance](images/R25C44.jpeg)

### Shaking Off

You learned that trick when you were a fox. All you have to do is shake your whole body and you'll be dry and clean in no time! Amazingly, even your clothes will instantly dry and smooth out, even if you've just crawled out of the swamp. 

![Shaking Off](images/R25C45.jpeg)

### Homesick

Your animal form requires you to stretch your legs at least once a week and walk through the wild woods in the form of a fox. Of course you can wait a little longer, but every day your longing for nature grows stronger and stronger, until one day you drop everything and run away from home.

![Homesick](images/R25C46.jpeg)

### Red Star

You didn't notice it before because you were too afraid to approach people, but... You love it when they play with you! In your animal form, you pose for people, yapping happily and doing tricks without even thinking about whether it's humiliating or not. It's fun!

![Red Star](images/R25C47.jpeg)

### Chibi Form

Sometimes when you're very excited or having too much fun, you can temporarily turn into an incredibly cute chibi-form! You become 500% cuter, so much so that people don't believe it's happening and often pinch themselves to wake up!

![Chibi Form](images/R25C48.jpeg)

### Sweaty

You have a completely different metabolism than humans and your body is noticeably hotter than theirs.  Fucking you is extremely pleasant, because the cock is additionally stimulated by your heat, but you also sweat a lot more, so you are always covered in your own and other people's sweat after hot fun.

![Sweaty](images/R25C49.jpeg)

### Floral Odor

Your new body smells surprisingly nice. Literally flowers, as if you were using some kind of perfume! You can even change the smell a little with your will! Ah, you'll have to find another kitsune and give her a good sniff! Maybe even lick her!

![Floral Odor](images/R25C50.jpeg)

### Tasty

Looks like you're also delicious... It's weird, why did you have to do that in the first place? Perfect body should have perfect flavor? You can probably understand tasty sweat, but... Tears? Blood? You cringe to think of all the other things... Not the urine! Screw it, let the perverts enjoy it, but what if your meat tastes good?!

![Tasty](images/R25C51.jpeg)

### Comfy Combo

You already said that, but damn, your body is just incredibly comfortable and cuddly! Your soft tail is the best thing to snuggle! Oh, maybe only your breasts or butt are even better, but you can't hug them yourself! Anyway, you're cozy anywhere and everywhere, it seems like you can even comfortably fit on broken glass! 

![Comfy Combo](images/R25C52.jpeg)

### Sleepy

You love to sleep, but you can only really get a good rest in strong male arms. You are literally ready to blow someone just to sleep in his arms! At the very least, you try to fall asleep at least with a man's shirt in your hands to smell his scent. 

![Sleepy](images/R25C53.jpeg)

### Fox Holes

This body is clearly made to have a lot of sex and all your holes are perfectly adapted to being fucked day after day by even the biggest dicks. Even a dick the size of your hand that makes your belly bulge and leaves your anus wide open will feel great!

![Fox Holes](images/R25C54.jpeg)

### All The Way

You don't seem to need that much physical food really, so your intestines are greatly simplified... So you can be fucked all the way through! Oh... well... guess it's unlikely that anyone other than a tentacle could actually do it, but any monster dick could easily fit in your ass!

![All The Way](images/R25C55.jpeg)

### Lunar Cycle

After each hard fuck, your holes get a little looser, so each time you'll have to find a partner with a bigger and bigger cock until you find yourself with a couple of horse dicks in your ass! But every full moon you become virgin tight again and you can enjoy the stretching from the beginning!

![Lunar Cycle](images/R25C56.jpeg)

### Cum Dump

Kitsune don't reproduce like mere mortals, so your uterus is really just a place to receive sperm. Literally a cum dump. And it's so damn sensitive! It's like one big g-spot! If someone with a long enough dick pushes in, you'll cum immediately and continue to cum with every thrust, no matter how much he fucks you.

![Cum Dump](images/R25C57.jpeg)

### Children

Your sisters will consider you very strange, because in fact, you can give birth to a fox-girl! This will not be a full-fledged kitsune, because you are magical creatures. But they will be very similar to you and even inherit some of your powers... Wow, will you become the founder of a whole race?

![Children](images/R25C58.jpeg)

### Universal Womb

You can bear the child of any race, any monster. Whoever comes inside you, you carry their child! Well... If you want to, because usually your body just absorbs the energy from the sperm. Or if you get so much cum in you that you can't consume it all! Also, any monster eggs mature perfectly in you, so be careful!

![Universal Womb](images/R25C59.jpeg)

### Fuck Hole

Your anus has a significantly increased sensitivity, and it is clearly improved to provide maximum pleasure to any dick and to yourself. It is hard for you to look at it closely and realize what has changed, but it feels tighter and firmer than in humans. And it is definitely not just a gut, but something more sensitive and elastic inside! 

![Fuck Hole](images/R25C60.jpeg)

### Made for Love

Your body is created perfect... so that any part of it is intended to give pleasure to guys. The butt, the breasts, the armpits, the thighs, the fingers, even the feet! It's hard to express, but they are just the way they should be for the best fuck, so even if you stomp on some pervert's cock, it will be the best stomping in his life!

![Made for Love](images/R25C61.jpeg)

### Never Stop

Your body is truly the perfect sex doll, so even if you pass out from pleasure, alcohol or whatever, your body will continue to mount, suck and jerk any dick it can get its hands on. Keep in mind that in this state you don't care who you suck, you will satisfy anyone, even your worst enemy!

![Never Stop](images/R25C62.jpeg)

### Heat

All foxes get in heat from time to time and it's normal... but only Kitsune gets one every month if she's underfed! You'll go into a lustful frenzy where all you can think about is sex, and you'll find it completely unbearable to live without a cock inside you. At least one, but more is better! Until you are full, you will even be willing to surrender to any monster just to be filled with cum!  

![Heat](images/R25C63.jpeg)

## Curses and Blessings



### Tits Above All

When most of your breasts are bare, they attract all the attention. Even the person you're talking to will be so caught up in the sight that they won't even notice your ears or tail. And if you shake it, they might not even notice that you are naked!

![Tits Above All](images/R26C1.jpeg)

### True Beauty

No matter how beautiful you are, your true beauty and attractiveness lies in your fox form. It's like you get +200% to your charisma when you're in your cute red fur! No one will be able to resist you!

![True Beauty](images/R26C2.jpeg)

### Saintess

When you are full of energy, you radiate a soft, warm glow, like a holy maiden. The followers of any Light Deities will be filled with kindness and respect for you, especially if you play along with their beliefs a little. Or at least if you don't swear and debauch!

![Saintess](images/R26C3.jpeg)

### High Noble

You are so handsome that any higher aristocracy will accept you as their equal. Kings and princesses will be happy to invite you in for a visit and a chat, and many princes will consider marrying you.

![High Noble](images/R26C4.jpeg)

### Bigger Fish

No matter how hard you try, no matter how much magic you learn, no matter what artifacts you collect, you can never feel the strongest. There will always be a more powerful enemy, so like a real fox, you will always have to be cunning and evade fair fights. 

![Bigger Fish](images/R26C5.jpeg)

### Love Magnet

If you fall in love with someone and often masturbate thinking about that person, then very soon they will catch you! And of course, it will be the moment when you are holding their picture or screaming their name while riding a dildo!

![Love Magnet](images/R26C6.jpeg)

### Prize

In any argument, everyone would love to nominate you as the winner! Even if it's your drunk friends arguing with strangers about who gets to pee furthest. Even if it's just some random guys in a tavern flipping a coin!

![Prize](images/R26C7.jpeg)

### Bad Luck

You will be constantly haunted by small and very annoying mishaps.  Usually it's not a big deal, and it's unlikely that an anvil will fall on you, but it's still very annoying.

![Bad Luck](images/R26C8.jpeg)

### Bad Omen

Your arrival often heralds misfortune for those around you. It's hard to say if you influence this or if you're just drawn to places where bad things are about to happen, but you'll be the one blamed.

![Bad Omen](images/R26C9.jpeg)

### Good Luck

You will have a lot of luck in small things. You won't spill hot coffee on yourself and a carriage won't splash water on you from a puddle, so your everyday life will be much happier and you won't have any major setbacks.

![Good Luck](images/R26C10.jpeg)

### Luck Stealing

You literally suck luck out of the people around you. And the worse it is for everyone around you, the better your life will be! However, if you live in a big city and interact with a lot of people, they will hardly notice.

![Luck Stealing](images/R26C11.jpeg)

###  Luck Sharing

Everyone knows that cute foxes bring good luck, so you will always spend a little energy to bless the people around you with fortune. You will have to eat a little more often, but the joyful smiles of your friends are worth it, right?

![ Luck Sharing](images/R26C12.jpeg)

### Lucky Charm

You can create a dozen amulets for your closest friends, so you can share your good luck with them even when they are far away. All you have to do is make a cute little fox plush doll out of your own fur!

![Lucky Charm](images/R26C13.jpeg)

### Wild Fortune

Your luck has clearly gone crazy, because now you will have many more critical successes... but also critical failures! It's as if your dice of fate now have three twenties and three ones!

![Wild Fortune](images/R26C14.jpeg)

### Sex Guru

You are so hot that anyone will become a real sex expert while fucking you! Even an innocent virgin will bang you just as well as a porn actor! Guys' dicks will even get a little bigger!

![Sex Guru](images/R26C15.jpeg)

### Captive

Any enemies in combat will not be trying to kill you, but rather capture you as a sex slave. After a few days or so, they'll probably let their guard down and you'll be able to escape.

![Captive](images/R26C16.jpeg)

### Peaceful

You'll also try to avoid violence and fight at half strength without killing. Battles will be more like friendly sparring, and if you win, you'll taunt them for a long time, sucking all their energy!

![Peaceful](images/R26C17.jpeg)

###  Defeat Conditions

If they tear your clothes, you surrender immediately. Moreover, you expect all your friends to do the same, so you even grab their hands to prevent them from fighting!

![ Defeat Conditions](images/R26C18.jpeg)

### Tied

Kidnappers always try to tie you up as securely as possible, but somehow it always turns out that they spend all their time choosing the most delicate rope and tying exquisite knots instead of using strong chains.

![Tied](images/R26C19.jpeg)

### Overload

They actually bind you VERY securely! Hell, they use so many sex toys that you can barely think straight from continuous orgasms! The ropes may be easy to tear, but you just don't have time to think about it!

![Overload](images/R26C20.jpeg)

### Nice Treatment

You never escape as long as you are well fed. As long as you are fucked at least a couple dozen times a day, you'll follow them around like a very obedient and happy puppy. However, it is unlikely that people will be able to keep up such a pace for long.

![Nice Treatment](images/R26C21.jpeg)

### Paw Prints

You will always leave fox tracks on the ground. Even if you wear shoes, even if you try to walk on your hands - you will leave the prints of your paws, not your heels.

![Paw Prints](images/R26C22.jpeg)

### Victim Aura

Your beauty will attract not only admiring fans, but also depraved rapists of all kinds. Be prepared for very persistent advances and even kidnappings with the goal of feeding you to the full!

![Victim Aura](images/R26C23.jpeg)

### Wanderer

Living in one place will quickly bore you and become stiflingly boring, so you'll often go on adventures. It is unlikely that you will be able to live in one house for more than a month or two.

![Wanderer](images/R26C24.jpeg)

### Tasty Bones

You will often be teased playfully with tasty bones as if you were a dog... And the worst part is that you won't be able to resist the temptation! They are really tasty! 

![Tasty Bones](images/R26C25.jpeg)

### Pitiful Appeal

Everyone will feel sorry for you and try to help you if you are in trouble. For example, if you are very hungry, girls may even ask their boyfriends to feed you, so sorry they feel for you!

![Pitiful Appeal](images/R26C26.jpeg)

### Guard Dogs

Guard dogs will always bark fiercely at you as if you were a wild fox. Well... Until you decide to get to know them better and play with them a little. A little treat and a hug will be enough! ...probably...

![Guard Dogs](images/R26C27.jpeg)

### Discipline

The guards and anyone who has authority will try to discipline you well, so for bad behavior or minor crimes, you will be severely scolded and spanked, which will make you feel embarrassed.

![Discipline](images/R26C28.jpeg)

### Too Wild

In large and developed cities, you'll be considered a dangerous wild animal, so you'll either have to hide really well or... Wear a muzzle, which is incredibly humiliating.

![Too Wild](images/R26C29.jpeg)

### Free Food

In big cities, foxes are forbidden to hunt... And so that you don't starve or hunt out of hunger, all fox girls are exposed to feeding! You must spend at least one hour a day at a special free feeding station.

![Free Food](images/R26C30.jpeg)

### Assistant

You have a hard time focusing on a really difficult task unless someone helps you. All it takes is a little licking of your pussy and a promise that you won't be allowed to cum until you solve the problem!

![Assistant](images/R26C31.jpeg)

### Send Help

Once you start masturbating, you won't be able to cum or stop until you have a real cock inside you. So you'll have to jerk off for hours waiting for a guy, or run out into the street and beg passersby to fuck you!

![Send Help](images/R26C32.jpeg)

### Unstable Illusion

No matter how hard you try to disguise yourself, any illusion is instantly dispelled if you sneeze. Your tail and ears will be in plain sight, even if you've been hiding them under heavy clothing!

![Unstable Illusion](images/R26C33.jpeg)

### Old Friend

A strange but very cheerful demon girl appeared as if out of nowhere. She behaves as if you are old friends, but you can't remember her... Could it be that you were acquainted in your past life?!

![Old Friend](images/R26C34.jpeg)

### Tail Mates

It turns out that all the monster girls in this world are very friendly with each other! All you have to do is wave your tails together to get on the same wavelength!

![Tail Mates](images/R26C35.jpeg)

## Additional Power Sources



## 

There is no doubt what will be your primary source of mana in this life. Male sperm, which almost glows with the energy that fills it, and which you can easily absorb! Just suck a few cocks and it will keep you in human form for weeks. Or even a few spells that would require an ordinary wizard to meditate for hours to gather mana.

But it seems that your new body is wonderfully adapted and ready to draw energy from less nutritious sources. After all, hey, you're not going to starve just because you can't reach the most delicious dish, right?       

### Foxing Around

The easiest way is to become a fox again and live in the wild. Just like before, you'll gradually accumulate natural energy, and most importantly, you won't spend anything. Fortunately, you won't need as much mana for the transformation as you did the first time.

![Foxing Around](images/R28C1.jpeg)

### Food

A good, hearty meal can help a little, but in fact, you can easily exist on semen alone. However, if you still prefer to eat like a regular mortal, this will cover about a quarter of the necessary energy to maintain this form.

![Food](images/R28C2.jpeg)

### Yummies

Expensive, exclusive sweets created with love and care are one of the best foods for foxes! And the more emotion is put into their creation - the better! You will also get even more energy if you will enjoy them together with someone else.

![Yummies](images/R28C3.jpeg)

### Fresh Blood

Fresh, hot blood, a still beating heart - it all contains much more energy than regular meat from the store! Sure, foxes are predators, but... Your sisters put so much effort into making everyone think kitsune are cuddly cuties... It's probably best not to ruin your reputation and act like a vampire.

![Fresh Blood](images/R28C4.jpeg)

### Taste

You won't collect much energy that way, but you can lick living beings to capture the energy they passively emit. The stronger the emotion they feel, the better! It could be the fear of the victim in your paws, the pleasure, or their uncontrollable laughter from being tickled by your tongue. 

![Taste](images/R28C5.jpeg)

### Pussies

Girls' pussies certainly can't feed you delicious cum... At least, unless someone fills them up good and proper... But still, female orgasms are also very tasty and nutritious! And you can make them cum again and again until you're full to bursting!

![Pussies](images/R28C6.jpeg)

### Monsters

Some monsters are overflowing with life energy! Their semen is tens of times more nutritious than a man's! And some kitsune say that just a few drops of dragon sperm is enough to last a whole year! In general, just choose those who are more resilient, stronger, or able to use magic!

![Monsters](images/R28C7.jpeg)

### Otherworldly

As much as the Kitsune try to hide it, their affinity with the otherworld is too strong. So all you have to do is spend a little time in an ancient battlefield or graveyard to get the energy. This energy has a different feel and taste, but it's no worse than the power of life!

![Otherworldly](images/R28C8.jpeg)

### God's Grace

Fox girls are very popular with the deities. First of all, you're cute and that attracts followers, and secondly, it's much easier to channel energy through you. Even an inexperienced fox is almost as good as a high priestess that has been practicing complex rituals all her life! So as long as you serve them or just live in the temple they will willingly feed you.

![God's Grace](images/R28C9.jpeg)

### Performance

You can bask in the limelight and other people's attention, collecting mana from strong positive emotions. You can dance for the audience, sing or play music - choose whatever you want. But it has to be a truly breathtaking performance! Fortunately, foxes have excellent musical hearing thanks to their cute ears!

![Performance](images/R28C10.jpeg)

### Moon Light

Sunlight is warm and pleasant... But it is the light of the moon that can fill you with power. It's best to dance lightly and slowly, naked, absorbing energy with your whole body! Remarkably, this power tastes divine... Could it be that the entire moon is the visage of one of the ancient, mighty gods, who shines generously by night?!

![Moon Light](images/R28C11.jpeg)

### Praise

Other people's praise and joy create a storm of responding joy in you that energizes you. It's an amazing, incomparable feeling! No, it's not an orgasm, it's something completely different, but just as pleasurable! So you're going to try really hard to be a good girl and be happy to let anyone squeeze you, cause joy wherever you go and feed off that joy yourself!

![Praise](images/R28C12.jpeg)

### Cuddle

Sweet hugs, kisses, jokes and fun seem to create energy out of nowhere. After all, even two fox girls having fun with each other can both become full! It is completely inexplicable, but foxes have been using this trick since ancient times and are always very happy to see their sisters and love to cuddle with them!

![Cuddle](images/R28C13.jpeg)

### True Love

Legends say that sincere love can "heal" a kitsune and turn her into a human... Haha, what naive nonsense! Just as long as there's someone around who loves you with all their heart - you'll always be fed up, so you won't need to look for fun on the side! After all, the embrace of a loved one is truly magical!

![True Love](images/R28C14.jpeg)

## Powers



### Shadow Play

The simplest illusions, which practically every fox can instinctively control. You can manipulate a patch of shadow a few meters away from yourself. This can help you hide, put on a show, or distract one opponent, but no more than that.

![Shadow Play](images/R29C1.jpeg)

### Illusions

You can subtly control your foxfire, giving it any shape and color. The illusion cannot be larger than you, and it requires your constant attention, but hey, it can be anything! From a few steps away, it is indistinguishable from reality!

![Illusions](images/R29C2.jpeg)

### Big One

Your illusions can now occupy a volume of several dozen cubic meters, and you can even divide them into several parts and control them from a distance of a hundred steps. You can completely replace reality in a single room.

![Big One](images/R29C3.jpeg)

### Autonomous

You have reached true mastery and can create illusions with autonomous control and an internal mana reserve. If you try hard enough, the illusion will last for several weeks and react exactly as you intended.

![Autonomous](images/R29C4.jpeg)

### Illusionary Clothing

You can create an illusion of clothing so convincingly that people will even be able to touch it. Of course, it doesn't keep you warm, but now you'll always be able to look fantastic and exactly as you want!

![Illusionary Clothing](images/R29C5.jpeg)

### Special Effects

You subconsciously create tiny, amusing illusions to express your emotions and make them more vivid and impressive. Now your air kisses are quite tangible and even leave a lipstick mark on the cheek!

![Special Effects](images/R29C6.jpeg)

### Just a Mask

Illusions in the hands of a skilled deceiver are especially effective. You can even fool a person into thinking that your furry ears are just a funny fox mask, even if they just saw you wiggle them. You'll likely be able to make them believe anything!

![Just a Mask](images/R29C7.jpeg)

### Invisibility

With these illusions, you'll be a true master of hide and seek! With just a little effort, you'll be able to become completely invisible and even conceal your scent and all sounds! You can hide a couple of people with you or even a whole squad if you know how to create large illusions.

![Invisibility](images/R29C8.jpeg)

### Double

You can temporarily take on the appearance of another person you touch with your tail, and this is not an illusion! For several hours, your body will change to exactly match even those details of their appearance that you did not suspect. 

![Double](images/R29C9.jpeg)

### Not a perfect

There will always be some small and completely absurd mistake in your appearance that will allow you to be distinguished from the original. Green hair tips, an extra finger, a too-long tongue, or something else!

![Not a perfect](images/R29C10.jpeg)

### Copy Fox

You not only copy the appearance, but also all the features and powers of your target! If they have wings and can fly, then you can too! The only thing is that you won't change your size, so if you try to copy a mighty centaur, the copy will be very small and cute!

![Copy Fox](images/R29C11.jpeg)

### Skill Mimicry

You can even copy skills if you hold onto your target tightly during the transformation. You won't be able to read their personal memories, but for several hours, you'll be able to become a great historian, artist, politician, warrior, general, or anyone else!

![Skill Mimicry](images/R29C12.jpeg)

### Genderswap

Now you can change your most intimate part and change your gender. Of course, you could copy someone else's body before... But this penis will be your own and just the way you want it!

![Genderswap](images/R29C13.jpeg)

### Pleasure Link

You are able to link your own pleasure with that of your partner! Of course, they won't feel like they're being penetrated, haha! Only pleasure and your orgasms, and you - theirs! And sex when you feel someone else's pleasure as your own is something special!

![Pleasure Link](images/R29C14.jpeg)

### Dream Invasion

One day, a brazen succubus burst into your dream and fucked you hard! But when you realized that this cheeky bitch was stealing your mana, you got so angry that you chased after her and didn't even notice how you ended up in your neighbor's dream. You had a great hunt that night, and you remembered this skill forever! 

![Dream Invasion](images/R29C15.jpeg)

### Possession

During an invasion of a dream, you can completely take control of a person's body. This requires a hell of a lot of mana, you'll have to suck a hundred dicks just for an hour of control, but damn, it can be just insanely fun and completely worth all the costs!

![Possession](images/R29C16.jpeg)

### Charm

No silly pheromones, no crude aura of lust like succubi and other nonsense! Just a little air kiss that will awaken love for you in a person! The effect lasts for several hours, and all this time you'll be their ideal, their living dream, their goddess, for whose kiss they will do anything.

![Charm](images/R29C17.jpeg)

### Long-Term

Charm itself requires a lot of mana, and its long-term version will almost certainly deplete your reserves... But hey, the victim will be happy to feed you again! They'll even invite their friends if you ask! And considering that the effect lasts for a whole month, you'll definitely have time to satiate yourself!

![Long-Term](images/R29C18.jpeg)

### Backfire

If you use charm on a person who already loves you, even secretly, the spell will work on you! You'll fall in love with them madly, ready to do anything for their happiness, even use charm again and again to stay their lover or slave longer!

![Backfire](images/R29C19.jpeg)

### Healing

You can share your stored energy with other living beings to heal them. But it's so damn expensive! One stabbing takes the energy of a liter of sperm! You can heal almost anything, even resurrect if it hasn't been more than an hour, but you'd have to quickly service a whole herd of horses for it!

![Healing](images/R29C20.jpeg)

### Charging Station

You can transfer energy not only to people, but also to objects. No matter what their source was, you can easily charge a magical artifact or an ordinary battery with your pussy. It's also expensive, but actually, ordinary mages require complex rituals to do it!

![Charging Station](images/R29C21.jpeg)

### Dash

You can make a powerful leap, practically instantly moving ten meters. And if you spend ten times as much mana, you can jump even while in the air! This will certainly save your life more than once, but you need to learn how to stop properly!

![Dash](images/R29C22.jpeg)

### Trap Sense

This is your seventh... Or is it eighth sense already? Oh, in any case, now you can sense any traps a few seconds before they trigger, so you always have time to jump away. If the trap is the whole room or something like that, you just won't want to go inside.

![Trap Sense](images/R29C23.jpeg)

### Escape Artist

All foxes are great at escaping danger, but you have a truly outstanding talent! Even naked, without weapons or tools, you can escape from any dungeon with monsters or prison! Once you decide it's time to run, you're practically safe!

![Escape Artist](images/R29C24.jpeg)

### Regeneration

Ugh... No matter how agile you are, sometimes damage is inevitable... But it's not that scary! As long as you have at least a little mana, your body will be able to quickly stop the blood, and with proper feeding, you'll be able to restore any damage in just a few days!

![Regeneration](images/R29C25.jpeg)

### Full Moon

During a full moon, all of your powers and abilities are doubled. Your senses become even sharper, your mind even keener, your pussy even tighter, and your orgasms even stronger! And during a red eclipse, which occurs every 5-10 years, your powers increase even more!

![Full Moon](images/R29C26.jpeg)

### Fast Digging

Foxes are great at digging in the ground! Cozy burrows, tunnels under fences... It may sound like something insignificant, but in fact, a kitsune with sharp claws digs at an unimaginable speed! You can bury a person or dig a tunnel in just a few seconds!

![Fast Digging](images/R29C27.jpeg)

### Morale Booster

A mischievous kitsune like you can always entertain and cheer up her friends! You're so good at it that in just a few minutes, you can inspire even tired people to take on their tasks with renewed strength! Or warriors to fight with doubled courage and strength!

![Morale Booster](images/R29C28.jpeg)

### Tamer

 You're damn good with wild animals. You can even lure a wild falcon to come down from the sky for a treat. Just put your hand up and wag your tail!

![Tamer](images/R29C29.jpeg)

### Water Walking

This is one of the many reasons why kitsune are considered ghosts... Because you're able to walk on water as if you weigh nothing at all, as if you're just a barren spirit!

![Water Walking](images/R29C30.jpeg)

### Fortune Teller

If you find the right crystals and carve runes, several times a week you'll be able to get an answer to any question about the near future of a person you touch during the ritual.

![Fortune Teller](images/R29C31.jpeg)

### Wild Card

Your fate is completely unknown! Fortune tellers will never be able to predict where you will appear, but moreover - you will be able to influence any predictions, changing other people's fates!

![Wild Card](images/R29C32.jpeg)

### Tinkering

This requires the right tools, but you're incredibly good at crafting all sorts of little things. Dolls, jewelry, wind up music boxes, locks, traps... only your imagination can limit you!

![Tinkering](images/R29C33.jpeg)

### Computer Savvy

In your past life, you obviously spent a lot of time at the computer. You're a great gamer who can tell hundreds of interesting plots and games... Oh yes, it seems you're also a good programmer, but it's unlikely that will help you now.

![Computer Savvy](images/R29C34.jpeg)

### Rumor Spreader

All you have to do is tell a "special" news story to just a couple of people to spread a new rumor around town, destroy someone's reputation, promote a new café or invite guys to a new glory hole!

![Rumor Spreader](images/R29C35.jpeg)

### Actual Fire

Some foxes have a special gift and are able to control not only ghostly lights, but also real, hot flames! Surprisingly, this doesn't even require additional mana!

![Actual Fire](images/R29C36.jpeg)

### Magic

Kitsune are great at sensing magic, but usually, their innate abilities are enough for them, so they rarely force themselves to learn real spells. But it seems that because you're living a second life, it'll be much easier for you!

![Magic](images/R29C37.jpeg)

### Refill

Your body clearly doesn't want to give up energy for stupid human spells! It's food, you don't play with it! Every time you cast a spell, you'll be unimaginably aroused, because your body will demand to immediately refill the mana you've spent!

![Refill](images/R29C38.jpeg)

### Curses

Uhuhu~ You've learned to control this gift with bad luck! Now you can deliberately curse people for misfortune or steal all their luck without a trace! Nobody will be able to stand up to you, mwahaha! Oops, it seems your fur has darkened a bit...

![Curses](images/R29C39.jpeg)

### Intuitive Spellcrafting

It seems that you have a real talent for magic. You can sense the most subtle nuances of spells, predict their effects in advance, and even compose your own spells on the fly, without fearing that everything will just explode!

![Intuitive Spellcrafting](images/R29C40.jpeg)

### Inscription

You are able to seal spells into scrolls or enchant items. You always know what kind of ink and special components are needed, what symbol to draw, and how long the spell will last.

![Inscription](images/R29C41.jpeg)

### Real Magic

Powerful spells and superpowers are important, but now you're capable of something greater! To provide unparalleled, amazing home comfort! Anyone who is lucky enough to experience your care will remember it with awe for the rest of their life!

![Real Magic](images/R29C42.jpeg)

### Ancestor

You are able to communicate with the spirits of the ancestors, with the great foxes who lived thousands of years ago and have themselves gone into the spirit world. They are always happy to give you advice or just to chat. Oh! They say they even remember how you foolishly ruined the Moon Tear a thousand years ago!

![Ancestor](images/R29C43.jpeg)

### Ghostly Vision

Like all foxes, you can see ghosts and the souls of the dead perfectly. Most of them hardly react to anything, absorbed in their own activities, but there are also very active spirits and even dangerous ones.

![Ghostly Vision](images/R29C44.jpeg)

### Bargaining

Many spirits and ghosts can be very useful if you know how to negotiate with them... So it's worth giving them a little energy and pleasure, and they will spy on your enemies or show where else the treasures of the ancient world remain.

![Bargaining](images/R29C45.jpeg)

### Manifestation

You are able to materialize spirits for a time. It's quite stupid to waste such a huge amount of mana to allow someone to return home for an hour, but summoning extremely dangerous ghosts who are always eager for fresh blood doesn't seem like a bad idea! The main thing is not to lose control!

![Manifestation](images/R29C46.jpeg)

### Fox Club

All kitsune can enter the spirit world, but usually inexperienced foxes can only spend a few minutes there... Unless they are invited to the special space of fox temples!! Here you don't expend energy and can rest for days, socializing with fox girls from all over the world.

![Fox Club](images/R29C47.jpeg)

### Pocket Dimension

Your connection with the otherworld is especially strong due to your rebirth, so you don't need thousands of years of experience to create your own small pocket dimension in the spirit world. Here there are only a few kilometers, but you can enter it at any moment, even with guests.

![Pocket Dimension](images/R29C48.jpeg)

### Immortal

The protection of the Moon Tear is still on your soul, it just needs to be re-energized... And in case of death, you will be reborn again with all your memories! Huh, the ancient spirits say that you won't even need a thousand years for this. In just a few years, you will be reborn as a fox again!

![Immortal](images/R29C49.jpeg)

## Companions



### Drowsy

This is one of your younger sister-foxes who decided to travel with you. In fact, she's also a kitsune and if there's an opportunity to have some fun, she'll gladly turn into a red-haired, busty beauty, but she likes her fox form much more. So, most of the time, she runs around on four paws, pretending to be your pet.
She's incredibly playful and mischievous, so she'll often play pranks, hide your things, and demand to play with her. But she herself doesn't know how to get offended, so you can tease her in return as much as you want!

![Drowsy](images/R31C1.jpeg)

### Adri Nerers

A noble boy, who bears the name of a great ancestor, decided to become a hero by all means, so he ran away from his castle in search of adventure. You laughed for a long time when you found this great warrior hiding on a tree from a wild boar, but still decided to help him. You quickly realized that he was a very sweet, kind, and smart guy... who didn't even know how to hold a sword properly. However, he begged you so much and was willing to do anything that you allowed him to travel with you ...as your personal sex toy? Oh, he's so cute blushing! What? He's in!? He just shyly asks to be called a squire and to be trained once in a while?

![Adri Nerers](images/R31C2.jpeg)

### Rachel Wanderfoot

For some reason, you always thought it would be a great idea to travel in the company of a merchant. So when you chatted with one of them in a tavern, you readily agreed to set out on the road together, but... Damn, where is her cart?! She may say that she has an enchanted backpack and it weighs nothing, but... but... What will you ride on?! This is a merchant's journey, you definitely won't walk by yourself!
Rachel only laughed when you turned into a fox and jumped into her bag, joking that now you're one of her goods. And only when in the next tavern she brought you a client, you realize that she was not entirely joking... But, as Rachel noted, you need a snack anyway, so why not make a little money on it?

![Rachel Wanderfoot](images/R31C3.jpeg)

### Dragons Whore

Actually, she prefers to be called "Dragons Bait"! Or just Lisa! But, damn, her fame runs ahead of her and everyone knows this legendary masochistic mercenary... She has an unimaginably strong body, so she often hires herself into palaces to be kidnapped by dragons instead of princesses. Usually, she returns after a few months, sometimes naked and scratched, sometimes in rich outfits... And again she goes to hire herself! Ordinary guys who can't satisfy her wanton lust and passion for submission haven't interested her for a long time, but kitsune... Hmm... Maybe you can entertain her a little? In return, she'll take you on a mission with her. She had heard that one dragon had long dreamed of twin princesses.

![Dragons Whore](images/R31C4.jpeg)

### Sir Frederick of Helzer

A legendary wandering knight that you were lucky enough to meet on the road. An unsurpassed swordsman in enchanted armor, a brilliant strategist and tactician, an inspiring leader and politician... He is worth a whole army and could have long ago seized a small kingdom for himself, but instead, for some reason, he travels the world, protecting the weak and always standing on the side of justice. He is silent and very serious, but for some reason, he kindly accepted you, although he previously rejected the help of whole armies of followers. Maybe he just needs a cute companion that will provide comfort, not battle buddies? And he also has a cute ginger hood that goes great with your fur!

![Sir Frederick of Helzer](images/R31C5.jpeg)

### Shreesh'tusha

You were very surprised when this humble, homely spider librarian asked to travel with you. She immediately confessed that she is not suited for battles and runs away with a scream at the slightest danger. But she runs really well, even on vertical walls, so you won't have to worry about her in battle! And she can tell you a million stories that she has read in books! And she can easily find the information you need in any large library, help you figure out ancient texts, translate even the most complicated spells and rituals into a language you understand! Oh, she also knows how to weave a web, so together you can cross any gap or wall. Don't worry, she can easily detach the web from your fur...
Except she forgot to tell you about her venom, which completely submits a person to her will for several hours and erases their memory... And that sometimes she has an uncontrollable desire to lay a few eggs, and her ovipositor is too gentle for masturbation... But, hey, you won't remember this, so everything is fine, right?

![Shreesh'tusha](images/R31C6.jpeg)

### Nilno "Summer Witch"

A cheerful elf who tries to literally merge with nature, feel it to the end and use it in her magic. She knows countless spells and rituals, many of which she invented herself, but always uses only those that correspond to the time of year and the environment. Now she is dressed all in green and behaves almost like a druid, but you don't even doubt that in winter she will change into white and try to merge with the blizzard. She set out with you on a journey, wanting to learn as much as possible about how kitsune collect and use mana. And she has already prepared several tails-plugs for herself, obviously intending to imitate you in everything! No matter what lewd madness you arrange, she will try to repeat everything after you! And even if you say that young foxes should only eat sperm, she will obediently accept it. You don't know if she can really learn your magic, but at least you yourself can definitely learn a lot from her in return, because she doesn't hide anything and is a great teacher.

![Nilno "Summer Witch"](images/R31C7.jpeg)

### Jeelara 

When you found a golden oil lamp in the desert, you immediately rubbed it for fun, remembering an ancient legend... But you definitely didn't expect that a real genie would appear before you! Surrounded by clouds of pink smoke, dressed in a lewd outfit of an eastern concubine, she obediently bowed before you, ready to fulfill any of your lustful desires~ And then she clicked her tongue in annoyance, realizing that you're not a guy at all! Oh, of course, she's willing to have some fun with you too, but... Ugh... you're not even a hero... And definitely not a sultan...
However, she sulked for only a minute, obviously unable to be sad for longer, and soon she was already happily stroking your tail. After all, you found her lamp and woke her up from sleep, so she'll go on a journey with you! In the end, she's heard that kitsune also love orgies and pranks, so you'll definitely be able to have fun together! She'll even sometimes fulfill your occasional wishes while you're together! 
...or maybe make you sultan after all, huh? She loved living in a harem so much.

![Jeelara ](images/R31C8.jpeg)

### Ranulf

A powerful, wild, dominant wolf with a huge cock and inexhaustible lust. In fact, you hadn't even thought of inviting him over, but he wasn't used to asking permission from meat holes. So your acquaintance began when he suddenly plowed you down and raped you for hours right on the road. You used to think there was no man in this world that could make you tired of sex... But he fucked and fucked. Your holes were full of cum, you were almost bursting with energy, but he raped you so hard and relentlessly that finally you passed out. 
You woke up still on his cock, but in the city. Ranulf was just explaining to the local mayor and priest that you are his new wife... You tried to object, but only blew a few bubbles of cum out of your mouth, and they didn't even bother to elaborate. Woflkin, foxkin - not much difference, and they didn't need a wild wolf rapist in their lands at all. So they performed a short ritual to bind you together. Now you officially belong to Ranulf, he can always find you and, in addition, if he rapes someone else you will be punished and literally tied to the wolf's cock with ropes.

![Ranulf](images/R31C9.jpeg)

### Nilroleia Aewenys

You've heard a lot about this elf princess, but you always thought it was just a silly, horny story made up by commoners... And you certainly didn't expect her to be as lewd as they described her! A perfect body of a true goddess, a sweet face, the behavior of a high-class aristocrat... And a crazy, slutty lust in her eyes, as if she's always thinking only about dicks and sex. A glowing butterfly on her bikini caught your attention, and Nilroleia immediately invited you to take a closer look, spreading her legs slightly. A soft humming left no doubt and soon her love juices were flowing down her thighs. This damned nymphomaniac and exhibitionist came right in front of you!  Without any embarrassment, she said that she just wanted to have fun and was confident that she would find the most naughty adventures in the company of a kitsune! After all, weeks in the tentacle pits had already bored her... Oh yes, this armor costs as much as a whole palace, so no one can hurt her, and to kill enemies, she just has to wave her enchanted sword a few times... But where's the fun in that?

![Nilroleia Aewenys](images/R31C10.jpeg)

## Items



### Tail Brush

A special brush that makes combing out the fur twice as pleasant. Even during the molt, you can take care of your tail in just a couple of minutes! Ugh, once you brag about it once, kitsune from all over the neighborhood come to visit you just to enjoy this brush!

![Tail Brush](images/R32C1.jpeg)

### Tamed Coin

You caught this tiny mimic when it tried to drag a coin right out of your wallet. Apparently, it was trained by some clever thieves, but the mimic will be happy to recognize you as its mistress if you start feeding and playing with it. It can pretend to be any coin, and if you pay with it, it will return to you, bringing another coin with it.

![Tamed Coin](images/R32C2.jpeg)

### Universal Toolkit

This set was given to you by a master craftsman who was very happy to remember his youth again... It folds into a very compact bundle that weighs only a few pounds, and inside you will always find exactly the tool you need. If your task has changed, just fold everything back, roll it up and unfold it for a new set!

![Universal Toolkit](images/R32C3.jpeg)

### Snake Counselor

This cute golden earring can wrap itself around any ear. And as soon as it is fixed, it will whisper to you various ways to outsmart the people around you. What exactly to say, when is the best time to steal, even how much money they have in their wallet! With her, you'll be cunning as Echidna herself!

![Snake Counselor](images/R32C4.jpeg)

### Flower Wreath

You simply braided a cute wreath for yourself, but the fairies liked it so much that they blessed it. Now a few tiny fairy butterflies always live in it, keeping the flowers alive and sometimes changing them for new ones. These are the simplest fairies that can't even talk, but it's still fun to play with them. Also, this wreath enhances your natural magic and repels mosquitoes.

![Flower Wreath](images/R32C5.jpeg)

### Rule Book

In this manuscript you can always find all the current laws of where you live. Even the unspoken rules of the thieves' guild! It also contains a ritual that can be used to change any rule for a while... But everything requires a monstrous amount of mana, so you'll have to lock yourself in a glory hole for a month to make everyone  go naked or something. 

![Rule Book](images/R32C6.jpeg)

### Headphones

Damn witches don't want to share their artifacts with everyone at all, so you just had to steal those headphones! And, hell, they look exactly like they did in your last life! Well, except they glow, consume mana, and can play seemingly any music in the world! All that's left is to figure out the controls, because right now you can only pick a random station... And damn, catfolk ritualistic howling is not the kind of music you might like!

![Headphones](images/R32C7.jpeg)

### Horn of Summoning

On one of the ancient battlefields, you noticed something glowing right out of the ground and dug a huge hole to find this demonic summoning horn. As soon as you blow into it, several random demons will appear next to you. Usually, it's a dozen of the lower imps or something like that, but someone more serious may appear. However, the horn does not give you any power over them at all... And if a couple of succubi will happily run with you to catch guys, you will have to run away from all the rest! Well... Or negotiate the payment!

![Horn of Summoning](images/R32C8.jpeg)

### Crystal Guns

You spent a lot of time trying to create pistols, but creating quality gunpowder, and even more, so primers was a very difficult task... So you just used magical crystals! This pair of pistols can fire up to two tiny fireballs per second, has a magazine of more than 1000 shots, and the replaceable crystals are easy to recharge by using your special talents! Also, they can make an boosted shot with all the remaining mana if you suddenly need to make a hole in the wall or something like that.

![Crystal Guns](images/R32C9.jpeg)

### Cozy Mimic

This ancient, huge mimic caught you in the catacombs and that could have been the end of your adventures for months... But he was sensible enough to ask you to bring him to the surface instead. He's willing to pretend to be any room you want and provide you with amazing comfort in exchange for just a couple feedings a week! Hell, somehow it mimics your old room so accurately that it even has light bulbs that glow, electricity in the outlets, and ice in the freezer! There's even water in the faucet! 

![Cozy Mimic](images/R32C10.jpeg)

### Feeding Suit

A powerful witch asked you to take care of her costume... Or rather, she caught you trying to steal some potions from her and cursed you as punishment. So you couldn't hurt this living suit, or take it off, or even stop it from invading your holes. And, damn, it took full advantage of this, raping you non-stop! Surprisingly, it didn't suck your energy like ordinary mimics, but on the contrary, it filled you up and amplifies your magic! So when the witch took the costume after a month, you even felt sad and empty... However, it seems that you are pregnant and soon you will be able to grow your own one!

![Feeding Suit](images/R32C11.jpeg)

### Game Console

It turns out that you need so little for complete happiness! Just a small game console from an ancient, a thousand years ago buried underground toy store. This model is much more advanced than those you've seen, made of a single piece of ceramic and damn durable. Also, there is a collection of several petabytes of great games here and there are even some classic titles from your own time! It's so addictive that sometimes you don't even want to go anywhere and you just shout out the window for a random passerby to come and feed you while you play!

![Game Console](images/R32C12.jpeg)

### Lightsaber

Huh, in the same ancient catacombs you found this lightsaber, which for some reason was also lying among various toys. At first you thought it was just glowing and buzzing, but when you jokingly hit a concrete column, it just sliced it in half and you didn't even feel any resistance! Ugh, during the blows it spends an incredible amount of energy, but it seems that this "toy" does not care at all what to cut - grass or a one-meter layer of steel armor! The only disadvantage is that it can't parry enemy weapons, and your energy will be enough for only a few blows. 

![Lightsaber](images/R32C13.jpeg)

### Portal Pistol

A smaller version of a portal gun, though... Your memories aren't exactly clear, but is a portal gun even real? Or is it from some game? Ugh... Either way it looks like someone in the past went to a hell of a lot of trouble to make their own version! Unfortunately, this gun creates very small portals in which it is convenient to stick your hand or head, but to get through completely you have to squeeze through them like a snake! And it's better to even undress, so that you don't accidentally get caught by your clothes and get stuck! 

![Portal Pistol](images/R32C14.jpeg)

### VR Station

This portable VR gaming station somehow fits in a compact suitcase, but as soon as it is activated, it turns into a small room with an interactive chair. Here you can immerse yourself in almost any virtual worlds, train in various dangerous things like battles with powerful opponents and even have a little fun! Oh, the sex here is especially realistic, your holes even sore afterward, as if they were really fucked while you were in full immersion! Aww... does it really charge like that?

![VR Station](images/R32C15.jpeg)

### Battle Fox

You can't help but get the feeling that someone has hidden all these treasures for you... Some of them are buried in the oldest parts of catacombs and underground tunnels where people have not entered for thousands of years, but... This suit is just made for you! It even has special energy protection for the tail! The armored container even says it's for Battle Bitches! Oh... And there's the MazeShow emblem again... Ugh, it looks like you already know exactly how this suit's gonna extract energy... Mmmm! And those vibrators are obviously XXXL size! But damn, you're almost invulnerable in that armor! 

![Battle Fox](images/R32C16.jpeg)

### Lunar Tank

When you found an ancient, horribly burned drop pod, you thought you'd only find rubble inside... but after several days of struggling with the molten metal, you freed a broken drone, which activated as soon as it was in the sun, greedily sucking up all the surrounding energy and causing the grass to wither and frost for a dozen paces. Tiny repair bots restored the vehicle, and soon you had a fully functional lunar tank! Hermetic, able to move quickly on any surface and even swim, armed with a powerful laser, well armored, and it absorbs any attacking magic to recharge a bit! And, hey, there are no any dildos inside! 

![Lunar Tank](images/R32C17.jpeg)

### Moon Tears

Sneaked into the treasury of one of the wealthy, you discovered with surprise and delight several tiny, but priceless Moon Tears. For now, they were just pretty pebbles, but you immediately realized that you could infuse them with energy! You're confident that the spirits of ancient foxes will guide you on how to conduct the proper ritual to create amazing artifacts! Oh, yes, of course, you remember that they allow rebirth after death in the same body,  But wouldn't it be better to slightly change them so that anyone who uses them would become a kitsune, just like you? After all, why not spread the fluff?

![Moon Tears](images/R32C18.jpeg)

### Fox Tamer

You have mastered ancient magic and become a true fox lord! At your gesture, dozens of ghostly foxes appear that can tickle any enemy with their fluffy tails! Oh, you mean burn them with fiery fox magic! Haha! Phew... Dealing with these spirits was pretty hard, and you have to often play and walk them in the real world, but damn it, it's worth it!

![Fox Tamer](images/R34C1.jpeg)

### Great Illusionist

Your gift in the magic of illusions is almost limitless. You are able to create giant illusions the size of entire cities and make them so lifelike and detailed that they can only be distinguished from reality by the fact that they cannot cause real harm, for even their touches are felt, and the pain from their bites is almost like the real thing.

![Great Illusionist](images/R34C2.jpeg)

### Fire Fox

You have become so attuned to fire magic that the hot flame has become your native element. Fire will never harm you again, even if you decide to walk on the hot lava in a volcano! Hm... It seems that even the opposite, wild fire can fill you with raging energy!

### EXPLO-OSION!!

You've studied many ancient manuscripts, spent hundreds of hours of research and bored a dozen archmages with your questions, and yet you've created the most powerful spell! You can blow up a whole mountain, but it's so mana-intensive that you'll have to blow a whole city for one use! Twice!

![Top Chef](images/R34C5.jpeg)

### Desert Fox

You spent a lot of time in the hot sands of the desert and for some reason, the dunes seem so native to you, so familiar... As if this is your real home. As if in a past life, you were not a simple person from the 21st century, but a magical prince or even a sultan... And even the desert itself whispers softly with the sand, as if recognizing your right to power.

![Desert Fox](images/R34C6.jpeg)

### Magical Mascot

You have an unusually strong sense of justice, you just can't sit idle when the world is evil and monsters threaten peaceful people! But... Ugh... You're too lazy to fight yourself...

![Magical Mascot](images/R34C7.jpeg)

### Star Guardian

If you think about it, you're actually the one who wants to be famous! And those micro-skirts are so cute! It might even be worth it to fight monsters once in a while. After all, so all the guys will dream about you and will always be happy to feed you before the hard battle for the fate of the world!

![Star Guardian](images/R34C8.jpeg)

### Sly Thief

Sly and nimble, the fox-thief is on the hunt for treasure again! No stash, no vault can be safe while you're around! Ancient catacombs, banks and even... Oh, no, you won't risk going to the dragon's lair... But you'll definitely rob the adventurers who wander nearby!

![Sly Thief](images/R34C9.jpeg)

### Wild Warrior

Among werewolves, strength and audacity have always been valued, and damn it, you're so badass that even the wildest and most ferocious wolves respect you! Your power and sass are legendary, and your explosive character and wild antics are so crazy that robbers often offer to pay you tribute without waiting for you to knock their teeth out! 

![Wild Warrior](images/R34C10.jpeg)

### Rock Star

This world is beautiful and fun, but there is still something missing... Good music kyu~! So you built an electric guitar and an amplifier from memory, and soon became a true rock'n'roll star! In every city you are eagerly awaited by thousands of fans, whose enthusiasm literally overflows with fun and energy!

![Rock Star](images/R34C11.jpeg)

### Fluffy Nurse

The pain and suffering of others is almost as unpleasant to you as your own, and you will never pass by a wounded person without caring for them. You have become a true symbol of mercy, and there are no more incurable diseases for you. And since you can even fix aging, you can heal entire countries by influencing old kings. 

![Fluffy Nurse](images/R34C12.jpeg)

### Cute Maid

Service has become second nature to you. You're so used to taking care of others that it's so lonely without a master! But having someone to scratch your ear and tell you that you are a good little fox is so amazing!!! And you love the peaceful, quiet life in rich mansions where you can enjoy taking care of the house during the day and serving as a sex doll for your master or his pets at night!

![Cute Maid](images/R34C13.jpeg)

### Famous Traveler

You just enjoyed traveling around this beautiful world. But then one day you decided to write a book and it became so damn popular! So much so that now whole cities are preparing for your arrival by organizing festivals and celebrations, because they know that your appearance will bring good luck and thousands of tourists will come after you inspired by your travel notes!

![Famous Traveler](images/R34C14.jpeg)

### Ancient Mystery

Kingdoms, magic and dragons are a lot of fun, but... Where the hell did all this come from?! You're already almost certainly sure that this is your homeland, just a few thousand years later, then where did it all come from? Hell, the spirits of the ancient foxes are just laughing and teasing, saying that your civilization was far from the first... You absolutely have to find out the truth!

![Ancient Mystery](images/R34C15.jpeg)

### Pure Miko

You have spent so much time in the temples of the light deities that you have soaked in their holiness, and have become so good at conducting divine energy that some deities even appeal to you personally, asking you to help their followers and perform a few miracles with their help. Ugh... Some stupid people have even started worshiping you themselves!

![Pure Miko](images/R34C16.jpeg)

### Dark Priest

You sow misfortune and curses so wonderfully, as if the northern winds, famine, and war are following you. Even the dark gods have paid attention to you. Their requests are simple for you, and the rewards are great. Your fur may be blackened, and many foxes may not even speak to you, but this power, this strength is so awesome! With their help, one day you will definitely be able to conquer this world!

![Dark Priest](images/R34C17.jpeg)

### Bimbo Fox

Succubi, horny monster-girls and tentacles are fun, but... This world has forgotten the joy of being a mindless bimbo! You have to revitalize this best of subcultures! The Kitsune can brainwash, and you can ask one of your sisters... and... Well, like... Haha! Right! You, like, have to set an example for other girls! Let everyone, like, see how great it is - to suck dicks and be a fuck doll!

![Bimbo Fox](images/R34C18.jpeg)

### Bunny Hunter

When you see a tasty bunny, your predator instincts often take over, and you just can't hold back! You have to catch them and brutally fuck them! They are your lawful prey, you are a fox! Ooh, grabbing them by their delicate ears while you pound their pussies with your huge futa-cock feels so damn good! Hm... it seems to you that there are too many bunnies walking around you in provocatively short skirts?

![Bunny Hunter](images/R34C19.jpeg)

### Drug Dealer

You develop a powerful potion that can make any guy a real monster in bed! He will become much stronger and will rape you until he loses consciousness from fatigue and pleasure, his sperm will become many times tastier and more nutritious, and his member will be twice as big! Surprisingly, once you've tried it just a couple of times, there are now a hundred willing test subjects and tons of customers around your house every day!

![Drug Dealer](images/R34C20.jpeg)

### Dream Master

You've mastered the art of entering other people's dreams so well that now, even without your mate, you can explore their fantasies at any distance. It's like you can visit thousands, millions of different worlds! Sometimes you can change the dream's rules and play with the victim as you please, but other times it's so realistic that you almost forget you're a fox, not some Japanese schoolgirl...

![Dream Master](images/R34C21.jpeg)

### Novice Mentor

Your human memories are unique, but usually young kitsune know almost nothing about humans and society, and it's quite difficult for them to understand the rules... So you decided to open a special school for them, where you'll teach them everything they need to know! And make them excellent, obedient and lustful sex slaves~ Maybe you'll even sell them to a good master! After all, that way they'll always be fed!

![Novice Mentor](images/R34C22.jpeg)

### Team Support

You love adventure, but you don't like to fight yourself, so you always set off with a team of experienced adventurers as support!

And at night you serve them all as a great cock warmer to make them feel their best at all times!

A sweet piece of fuck meat like you rarely goes unnoticed..... You're so damn easy to beat, and your ass gets too much attention, so monsters, brigands, bandits, and perverts of all stripes kidnap you over and over again! Often just hours after you're free! No matter what you do, it's not long before you find yourself tied up and stuffed with dicks again! Gradually you will get used to it and will consider yourself only a toy in other people's hands, meat for fucking that should obediently give yourself to anyone and enjoy everything they do to you!

### Fox Leader

Thanks to your memories of a past life and a former world, you've become way smarter and cunning than all the foxes living nowadays. At least, those who give a damn about fighting for power. The ancient spirits haven't been meddling in such matters for a long time, so pretty soon, you found yourself leading thousands and thousands of kitsune all over the world, communicating with them in the spirit realm. Well, looks like the fate of the foxes is in your hands now!

### Happy Slaves

Life on the leash of depraved perverts and in brothels soaked with sweat and semen - that's the best thing that could be thought up for bitches like you! Cheap glory holes, pimps that take away all the proceeds leaving only sweet humiliation, hundreds of cocks to be serviced daily, underground shows with beasts and monsters... Isn't this heaven on earth?! Under your leadership, the kitsune quickly forgot about their false pride and gave in to beastly lust and endless sex! And not a single one of them regretted it!

### Pets

You had to work very hard, but soon people forgot that kitsune are actually a type of demon that communicate with dead souls and feed on human life force... Now everyone believes they're just cute little foxes! Many of your sisters have even changed their sexy appearance to something more kawaii! Gradually, you've even managed to make it fashionable to keep young fox girls at home, play with them, pamper them, and feed them feelings of happiness!

### Kingdom Come 

Hiding in forests, lurking in cities, concealing your ears and tail from humans... How long can you put up with that?! By summoning all the kitsune on the continent into a single, powerful army, you easily... Oh, no, you didn't have to wage war, you just secretly seized all the power and then declared this kingdom your own! With your knowledge, you'll easily build the richest and most prosperous city in the world! And it will be the most sophisticated brothel, where fox-girls, as the new aristocracy of these lands, can enjoy the tastiest guys!

### Foxkin

A lot of time has passed, but you definitely have something to be proud of, as your daughters, the cute fox-girls who no longer need semen to maintain their bodies, are now in the millions and are an integral part of society! Very few of them remember that you created this new race, and many don't even believe that magical kitsune foxes exist... but does that really matter? Every time you see mischievous pointed ears or a fluffy tail, you can't help but smile at your descendants, knowing that you made this world a much better place!

### Bimbo-Foxkin

Your sweet daughters have inherited all your strongest, best qualities! Oh, certainly not all that silliness with magic or ridiculous martial arts! Just your endless lust and desire to serve men! Apparently they can even get some energy from semen, so each one of them is a wonderful tireless lover! And their numbers are getting bigger and bigger! A whole race of bimbo-foxkins that live only for cock and think of nothing else!

### Live Legend

You've been such an outstanding person, and your exploits and adventures have impacted the world so much that they named an entire constellation after you! It may not be big, but hey, all your furry sisters are whining with envy and even the ancient spirits approvingly say that you now have a private place in the sky! And after you've secretly staged colorful illusions right in the sky a few times, people have come to think of this constellation as very special and bringing good luck.

### NEET

Monsters, magic, and adventure have quickly become boring to you. Dungeons are full of creepy traps and other dangers, mountains are full of monsters you have to run away from, and in faraway lands you have to learn a new language every time... Hell, even just the forest is full of mosquitoes! And the morning dew is so cold! Brr! So once you've gotten or created your usual entertainment, you immediately lock yourself in your room! Luckily the Glory Hole you made in the wall is quite popular, so you don't have to go outside at all.

### Commoner

It took a long time, but society began to evolve again. The magic available only to a few was replaced by reliable technology. Tight streets and grand palaces were replaced by cities made of concrete and glass, and monsters once again hid in the darkness, waiting for their time... Surprisingly, you've missed this life of a simple city dweller! A simple job, a TV show, the bright lights of the city at night... You hardly use any magic enjoying this life and the bustling nightclubs and only sometimes you think about the fact that thousands of years ago foxes must have been hiding in society just like that.

### Illusory Tech

Even with all your talents, it took you several years to build this prototype! Yes, it's a clock! But the point is, it's just an illusion that's fueled by mana, it'll last for years always showing the exact time! And hey, the best part is that now you know how to program the illusion any way you want! It's almost like a microchip, only way better! In the next version, you'll need to attach a keyboard, create a few programs and you'll have a primitive, but working computer that anyone can use! Haha! You're a bloody genius!

### Back to the Future

With your help, civilization developed at an insane rate. Instead of centuries of progress, you simply gave mankind the most advanced technology! Science and magic merged together and soon archmages were launching spaceships, and the stunning shining cities of the future often welcomed camel caravans from distant lands, readily exchanging cell phones for magic crystals and rare alchemical ingredients! Even MazeShow was interested in your technology, adding even more awesome craziness to this cyber-magical future!

### Big Bad Fox

The humans are letting themselves too much! Their cities are taking over more and more territory, and the smoke from the factories is covering everything with filthy soot! They even wanted to cut down your native forest to build a farm and that was the last straw! Your rage and the secret help of your new friends transformed you again revealing your third form - a huge demonic fox! You raged through the city like wildfire, your powerful paws crushing buildings like they were made of straw, and entire armies turning to ashes unable to harm you! Civilization was destroyed once again, but... hey, you like this wild fantasy much more!

### Wild and Free

You tried to live in the cities and pretend to be a human, honestly. Yes, you remember that you used to live like that before, but... damn, being a human is too hard! Come to think of it, you never really liked it, but the carefree life in the forest was so wonderful! So you ran away and turned back into a regular, cute, mischievous and fun fox! Ah, how amazing is this wilderness! These forests, fields, rivers! The intoxicating thrill of the hunt, playing with your sisters, fiery sunsets, cozy dens and ozone-filled air after a thunderstorm! Seriously, a couple of rabbits and freedom is all a fox needs to be happy!
