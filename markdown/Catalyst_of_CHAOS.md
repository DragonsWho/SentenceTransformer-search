<div style="color: #9e2323; text-align: right;">Hey! He finally woke up! I told you I could do it!</div><div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;">Hmm... Indeed, it seems he's still alive... 
In any case, it doesn't matter now. While you were fussing with this body, I already created a clone and released it outside to cover up the traces of your little... mishap.</div><div style="color: #9e2323; text-align: right;">Hold on a second...</div><div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;">I'm sure he's already returned home, so you have nothing to worry about; your beloved Anon is perfectly fine and probably reading another hentai.</div><div style="color: #9e2323; text-align: right;">But... But this is...</div><div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;">Don't worry, no one will notice anything. 
Just push these remains onto the shelf; the biomass will be useful as dinner for specimen number 534.</div><div style="color: #9e2323; text-align: right;">Mimmi, how could you?! 
This is Anon we're talking about! He's... He's still alive!</div><div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;">Ugh... That's why I told you not to waste time... His place in this world is already taken, and because of your magic, his soul has already changed, and now he's growing horns and hooves... We can't just heal him and let him go.</div><div style="color: #9e2323; text-align: right;">But... but... You'll figure something out, right? 
Or I can call the Guy, and he...</div><div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;">No! Not him! Wait, put the phone down! We'll handle this ourselves! 
I... Yes, I just had an interesting theory that's worth testing!</div><div style="color: #9e2323; text-align: right;">Huh?</div><div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;">Yes, yes, a corrupted soul will be perfect! You hit him with a truck, right? Which means...</div><div style="color: #9e2323; text-align: right;">It's Isekai time!!!</div><div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;">That right! 
Though I'm afraid he can no longer be a knight of light and a hero... but you said he likes raping and monsters anyway, right? So he'll surely make an excellent Dark Lord... 
Hey, are you still alive? Blink if you can hear us* </div><div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: right;"><small><small><small>* and are ready to accept this fate.</small></small></small></div>

### Blink



![Blink]()

##  


<div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;">Excellent! Glad to see you're ready to cooperate, test subject 7947! Now we just need to...</div><div style="color: #9e2323; text-align: right;">A test subject? Hey, Mimmy, it's Anon! 
I've sucked him off so many times...</div><div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;">Don't worry, it's standard procedure.
Anyway, let me finish his transformation. 
So, test subject, unfortunately, the remains of your body are in terrible condition, so we'll need to recreate it from scratch... 
And no, I can't just make a copy of your old body, that's so boring... I mean, completely unsuitable for the experiment... uh... incompatible with your corrupted soul!</div><div style="color: #9e2323; text-align: right;">Hey, he's about to die again from the prolonged boring prologue!</div><div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;">Right, so here's the 
<b>TLDR: quickly choose what type of body you prefer, so I can transform you into a monster and prep you for the experiment!</b></div>


## 



### Beast

A large, strong, and very dangerous beast. A standard monster, perhaps, but perfectly suited for my experiment. I mean, a powerful body, a massive dick, endless lust... Everything should be just perfect!

![Beast](images/R4C1.avif)

### Demon

Well... You already have hooves growing because of that succubus's magic, so turning you into a demon won’t be difficult at all... A magnificent battle form, lots of bony spikes, horns, a tail, a huge spiked dick designed to cause pain... A classic specimen for the experiment!

![Demon](images/R4C2.avif)

### Werewolf

Half-human, half-terrifying monster-wolf; a werewolf that howls at night and ravages anyone who trespasses on its territory. Yes, I think this will do! You'll have a free human form, but you'll be much weaker at controlling your beastly half.

![Werewolf](images/R4C3.avif)

### Deep

A dark, mysterious form with a multitude of tentacles, enigmatic shadows, and mind control... I think this will be perfect for pretending to be one of the emissaries... I mean, haven’t you dreamed of catching some beauty in your lustful tentacles? Soon, this will be your reality!

![Deep](images/R4C4.avif)

### Tyrant

I have no idea from which world Succa brought this T-virus, but it allows for the creation of excellent monsters! Enormous strength, random mutations, 100% infectivity! And since there are no grenade launchers in the new world, you have nothing to fear...

![Tyrant](images/R4C5.avif)

### Cyborg

Ah, craving a bit of cutting-edge technology? I happen to have a spare cybernetic body, a spare copy of one of Night City's finest assassins. Top-of-the-line Arasaka tech, which I slightly enhanced with a nitrite reactor so you won’t need to recharge every couple of hours!

![Cyborg](images/R4C6.avif)

### Ghost

I don’t know, I’ve never liked these chrome gadgets and chips... Real flesh is so much better! And a human soul is a true masterpiece! Especially if it’s slightly enhanced, allowing you to change bodies and exist in a bodiless form for some time...

![Ghost](images/R4C7.avif)

### Magitech

Well... Okay! A bit of this, a bit of that... Maybe a magical core will help you in the new world? I don’t know, decide for yourself what you like best. In my opinion, tentacles are a much more reliable choice than all this magitech assembly...

![Magitech](images/R4C8.avif)

### Symbiont

Or here’s a great symbiote! Of course, you’ll need to catch a host body to fully unleash your abilities, but isn’t that wonderful? I mean, always having someone inside you, continuously enjoying their body, changing them, enslaving their mind... but you'll have to let them use your power most of the time!

![Symbiont](images/R4C9.avif)

### Glitch

Oh, sorry, I haven’t fully studied this form yet. I mean, it’s a copy of one of the versions of the mad scientist who caused the Fusion, trying to escape the dark gods... I think it’s not quite successful; due to the Fusion with the eighth dimension, it constantly disappears from reality and is terribly inconvenient to work with...

![Glitch](images/R4C10.avif)

### Swarm

There's no need to limit yourself to a single monstrous form. Why not become a swarm? In fact, it's even more convenient - each body may be weaker, but you can inseminate more vaginas at the same time, right?

![Swarm](images/R4C11.avif)

### Futa Fairy

Oh, right, Anons love to be the girls, don't they? How about a dark fairy? Futanari, of course, with a magnificent fairy phallus! Mmm... No, sorry, I don’t think you can birth enough monsters on your own. The experiment requires… certain functionalities.

![Futa Fairy](images/R4C12.avif)

## 



### Monster Boy

You'll be able to change your form to something more or less humanoid. Oh, don't worry about where the excess mass goes; that's not your concern. In any case, people in the new world will soon get used to this appearance, but we'll cover that in the next part of the experiment...

![Monster Boy](images/R5C1.avif)

### Nice Suit

Your fur, scales, bone, or stone growths will always appear to humans as merely a complex and detailed costume or a strange magical armor. Well, you've probably seen furry suits at comic conventions or something like that, right? But yours will be much cooler and more beautiful!

![Nice Suit](images/R5C2.avif)

### Dragon Blood

I recently got incredibly lucky and obtained a few drops of dragon blood! You probably can't even imagine... What? How do you know? <div style="color: #9e2323;">Oh, just roll a die to take 2 random abilities from your build in Dragon's Echo...</div>

![Dragon Blood](images/R5C3.avif)

## 



### Sleek Form

Your second form is hardly more humanoid... It's more like a secondary combat form, much more agile and fast than your primary, hulking demon form. At the very least, you'll find it much easier to squeeze through tight dungeons and sneak up on enemies!

![Sleek Form](images/R6C1.avif)

### Hellish Covenant

Fun fact - for demons, loyalty to a contract is literally written in their DNA! And maybe in their souls? Either way, if you swear not to enter a house, even your flowing blood will stop at the threshold! Phew, fixing this won't be so easy, maybe we should leave it as is? At least if someone drinks your blood while swearing an oath to you, they won't be able to break it!

![Hellish Covenant](images/R6C2.avif)

### Demon Lord

You'll have the blood of one of the higher demons who recently disappeared somewhere, maybe even died. So out there, in hell, there are whole hordes of lesser demons ready to accept you as their master and respond to your summons. Just pretend you have amnesia or something... And pray that the real demon lord doesn't suddenly resurrect, as often happens with them.

![Demon Lord](images/R6C3.avif)

## 



### Big Bad Wolf

Oh, well, like I said, you'll have a free human form, but... Actually, it's gonna be pretty wild, too.... Werewolves aren't exactly known for their self-control, huh. But most importantly, they're very fond of breeding! And the long fangs, the crazy eyes, the hunger for raw meat... It's just the little things.

![Big Bad Wolf](images/R7C1.avif)

### Poor Control

Not only will you have to deal with instincts, hormones, and mind-clouding rage and lust... Your form itself will be unstable, so that under the light of the full moon, or during particularly intense emotions, your bestial essence will break through and change your body.

![Poor Control](images/R7C2.avif)

### Pack Leader

You'll have the aura of a true alpha male, so other monsters will always recognize you as the pack leader. Well, you might have to prove your strength in combat with the former leader, but after that, everyone will obey you without question.

![Pack Leader](images/R7C3.avif)

### Night Predator

Your new body is perfectly adapted to a nocturnal lifestyle, so under the moonlight, your senses will sharpen by almost twofold, and your strength and speed will noticeably increase! During the day, you'll usually prefer to catch up on sleep before the next hunt.

![Night Predator](images/R7C4.avif)

## 



### Pseudohuman

You'll have an excellent human form! But, it will be as if woven from tentacles that will continuously writhe, so you'd better not take off your clothes around people... But at least your face will be almost indistinguishable from a real one! Just don't open your mouth too wide or stick out your tentacle-tongue, and no one will suspect a thing!

![Pseudohuman](images/R8C1.avif)

### Tentacle Pit

Yes! Screw the human form! Now you can transform into a giant room filled with tentacles to properly enjoy your tasty victims! Ah, how I miss the days when I could allow myself to just have fun with... mmm... Oh, right, the experiment! Well, I guess you could even expand your form to take up an entire castle if you had enough energy.

![Tentacle Pit](images/R8C2.avif)

### Underwater

Of course you'll be able to breathe underwater, that's child's play to accomplish! Your Deep form will even have new organs to help you navigate the waters, ignore any pressure, and swim at about 100 miles per hour. Sorry, even a monster can't go faster than that due to cavitation, but hey, you can always hitch a ride on some currents!

![Underwater](images/R8C3.avif)

## 



### Absorption

Although the T-virus is rather outdated technology, it still allows for interesting results! Oh, don't worry, of course it's no longer contagious - I removed that! But you'll be able to literally absorb other bodies, making them part of yourself! So if you find some enchanted arm or something like that, you can simply attach it to yourself!

![Absorption](images/R9C1.avif)

### Nurgle's Blessing

Ugh... I really don't like dealing with this guy, but he'll surely like your new body... So if you want, I can show you a small ritual and Nurgle will fill you with energy, making you his champion in the new world. But the price will be high - although you'll become almost unkillable, you'll be eternally rotting alive, suffering from a bunch of diseases, which isn't very pleasant...

![Nurgle's Blessing](images/R9C2.avif)

### Plague Master

Your T-virus mutation will allow you to control diseases and even the behavior of infected people. Most likely, humans will quickly adapt and learn to wash their hands and wear masks, but they'll still hate you terribly for it. And don't get carried away with big epidemics, or the virus will mutate again, and you'll have to fight zombies yourself.

![Plague Master](images/R9C3.avif)

## 



### Cyber Shell

This body of yours is just a complex mechanical doll to which your soul is attached. Sorry, I don't know much about technology, these are just old developments from the geniuses on the 77th floor that Succa brought here. Anyway, the maintenance manual will be uploaded to your brain, so you can fix or replace something yourself! Maybe even make a human face!

![Cyber Shell](images/R10C1.avif)

### Chrome

Um... sorry, it looks like they didn't really think about the appearance, or they were trying to replicate some video game, so no matter how hard you try to pretend to be human, mechanical parts will always be noticeable, like glowing sensors instead of eyes, or an electronic voice. But these parts are much more reliable and easier to make!

![Chrome](images/R10C2.avif)

### Built-in Weapons

Your new body will have a bunch of built-in weapons, all kinds of lasers, machine guns, poisoned hidden blades, shotguns, rocket launchers, and other boy toys. Oh, no, don't worry - all the ammo is infinite! Or rather, it replenishes itself every few hours, but that's almost the same thing. I wonder how they managed to replicate this cheat code in the real world?

![Built-in Weapons](images/R10C3.avif)

### Missile Barrage

Actually, the superpowers section will be later, but... Okay, this is just a body feature, right? Once a month, you'll be able to fire a salvo of hundreds of incredibly powerful rockets that will destroy everything around! Unfortunately, they're very simple, so they fly randomly and hitting a particularly agile target will be difficult.

![Missile Barrage](images/R10C4.avif)

## 



### Live Armor

This ancient magic is so amazing and captivating! We don't even need to create a body for you; we can simply strengthen your soul to the point where you'll be able to move small objects or possess more or less humanoid objects like armor or dolls and control them as if they were alive! Just don't try to possess a corpse, as that's what sent the previous test subject off to reincarnation...

![Live Armor](images/R11C1.avif)

### Possession

But you can possess a living person! Two souls will be incredibly cramped in one body, and you'll be expelled after a couple of hours, but during that time, you can control the body like your own puppet! If you stay silent, the person's subconscious will even come up with some silly explanation for the behavior and believe it!

![Possession](images/R11C2.avif)

### Poltergeist

You can enhance your soul even more, so you'll be able to interact with living beings much better! You'll be like an invisible man that can fuck a girl at any time and that she can't do anything against unless she has magic! Well, you could probably even hit someone, but fucking is more fun, isn't it?  

![Poltergeist](images/R11C3.avif)

## 



### Mechanical Doll

This body of yours is just a complex mechanical puppet to which your soul is attached. Anyway, all the necessary technical knowledge will be imprinted into your consciousness so that you can fix, improve or replace something yourself, you just need simple tools and a lot of time! Maybe even make a human face!

![Mechanical Doll](images/R12C1.avif)

### Simplified Procedure

Hey... This is going to be a real challenge! But I think I can make your soul organize the matter itself, so you'll only need to find basic materials in the form of fine powder and lots of energy! And then visualize in detail what you need! Oh... it may not be easy, but I think you can do it!

![Simplified Procedure](images/R12C2.avif)

### Tech Affinity

It will be very easy for you to connect to any technology. If a cyborg needs the right connectors, drivers and helper software, you can just plug a wire somewhere and connect your consciousness directly. Or even just hug the tech and try to make mental contact with it!

![Tech Affinity](images/R12C3.avif)

### More Magic Cores

You will be able to form additional magical cores in your body. This requires primordial crystals that are incredibly hard to find and usually only found in the crowns of great kings, but you can do it! Uh... I guess! In any case, even one crystal will increase your magical potential several times over!

![More Magic Cores](images/R12C4.avif)

## 



### Hollow

You will be able to travel without a host, but the emptiness inside will be one of the most unpleasant sensations imaginable. Even if you starve for weeks on end, even then your thoughts will be focused on finding a suitable host, not on finding food. 

![Hollow](images/R13C1.avif)

### Extra Tools

You will be able to freely change your form by growing additional limbs, integrating simple mechanisms, weapons and additional armor for the host in your body. You'll even be able to create separate “costumes” that you can store in your closet to quickly merge with them when needed!

![Extra Tools](images/R13C2.avif)

### Irresistible Power

Your power will be extremely attractive, any girl who feels what it's like to possess a powerful symbiote will quickly succumb to this temptation and soon she won't care what she does or who she fights, as long as she's with you! You'll still need to negotiate with hosts, but they'll crave you even if it means constant sex and betraying allies.

![Irresistible Power](images/R13C3.avif)

### Second Half

The more you spend time with your host inside, the more you will become attached to her, until you fall in love with her completely! After all, it's not just some captive and corrupted heroine, it's your dear host who you feel every millimetre of her skin, every beat of her heart and almost every her thought inside you!

![Second Half](images/R13C4.avif)

## 



### Shadow Form

I think I can at least increase the stability a little. So your ‘human’ form will be woven from shadows and only a little bit smoky, but it will hold its shape much better than before. Standing in the bright sun will be awfully unpleasant, but in general, if you put on a thick cloak, you can pass for a mysterious traveler.

![Shadow Form](images/R14C1.avif)

### Ethereal

I'm going to improve your control a little bit, so you can not only fall through objects at random, but you'll be able to slip through walls on purpose! You'll even be able to control your density so that you can freeze in place, climb higher, or let an arrow pass through you! Best of all, you'll now be able to carry your clothes along with you!

![Ethereal](images/R14C2.avif)

### Short Way

You can jump into any picture, online broadcast and so on as if into a portal! The main thing is that the picture depicts a real place and that it hasn't changed too much since then! In addition, you can even create your own ‘live pictures’ that will be updating every few hours!

![Short Way](images/R14C3.avif)

## 



### Champion

You can concentrate on one body, giving it most of your power, so it becomes bigger and smarter than the others. And the more bodies you have in your swarm, the smarter and stronger your champion will be, so even a pathetic goblin can become a decent guy.

![Champion](images/R15C1.avif)

### Mosaic

You'll be able to completely subdue small animals, insects or birds for a while, forcing them to assemble into some semblance of your body.  Of course it looks awfully uncomfortable, and it is. But you can subdue mice right inside your enemy's castle, and their death will mean nothing to you. 

![Mosaic](images/R15C2.avif)

### Alchemy

It's very energy-consuming, but you can modify parts of your “body” to give them special properties. Acid ants that can melt steel, unimaginably fast rats, beetles whose shells won't penetrate a bullet! The possibilities are endless!

![Alchemy](images/R15C3.avif)

## 



### Elemental Afinity

All fairies have their own element, usually it's what they are born next to.... It'll help you a bit with that element's spells, but more importantly, you'll be able to create subtle tentacles out of pure elemental energy. Hmm... I bet that must be very useful?

![Elemental Afinity](images/R16C1.avif)

### Lightning Form

Wow, looks like you were lucky to get the element of electricity! That's right though, my bunker's full of electrical appliances. Okay, I guess you'll eventually learn how to completely turn your body into a ball of lightning or something, but I'm afraid to imagine how much mana that would require. 

![Lightning Form](images/R16C2.avif)

### Dark Hallucinations

Dark fairies have one unpleasant peculiarity... They cause creepy hallucinations in everyone around them! It is incredibly difficult to suppress this ability completely, so sometimes those who look at you will see absolutely grotesque frightening things. And if you stare at someone for a long time, the whole world will begin to distort for them.

![Dark Hallucinations](images/R16C3.avif)

### Pixie Queen

Pixies may be able to travel between worlds, or they may just appear out of nowhere, and there will always be plenty of them around you. They'll even consider you their queen, because you're so big and mighty! They're not very smart, they're terribly mischievous, and they can get very offended if you don't play with them... but you can turn them on your enemies!

![Pixie Queen](images/R16C4.avif)

##  


<div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;">Great! At least you're not dying anymore, test subject 7947! 
Sure, you can't move or feel anything yet, but don't worry, I've thoroughly checked your condition!</div><div style="color: #9e2323; text-align: right;">Yeah-yeah, you've been licking him for hours! 
Lucky for you, Anon, you were unconscious during this transformation!</div><div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;">Ahem! 
Don't worry, the anesthesia will wear off soon, which means all that's left is to send you to the new world...</div><div style="color: #9e2323; text-align: right;">Hey! Wait! You can't do that! 
You can call him a test subject and secretly play with his unconscious body, but only a few options for creating a body? 
That's definitely against the rules! It's way too little!</div><div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;">. . . . .
Fine... 
But if he asks to create some ridiculous monster like a fluffy cyborg with tentacles,  it's not my fault!</div>


### Pointy Ears

Okay, let's see where standard surveys usually start... Do you want pointy elf ears, test subject? Are you sure? Oh, fine, after all, the Uruk-hai also have pointed ears...

![Pointy Ears](images/R17C1.avif)

### Strong

No, screw the eye color choice! The anesthesia will wear off soon, so let's move on to more substantial things! Do you want to lift two tons with one hand? 

![Strong](images/R17C2.avif)

### Perfect Condition

Oh, that will definitely come in handy! Now, your body will always maintain itself in perfect shape, even if you don't exercise for years and just watch TV or play games!

![Perfect Condition](images/R17C3.avif)

### Giant

I'll increase your body size a couple of times, so you'll become truly huge! Ordinary females will be like dolls in your hands, so don't forget to take the hentai field later!

![Giant](images/R17C4.avif)

### Speed and Grace

Do you want to be super fast? Catch arrows in mid-air, outrun the best horses, and run up walls to the fifth floor? You'll also have much better control over your movements!

![Speed and Grace](images/R17C5.avif)

### Dash

A bit of extra muscle in your legs will allow you to make truly swift jumps! Almost at the speed of sound! Better not try to break that barrier if you value your ears...

![Dash](images/R17C6.avif)

### Skin Color

Oh, believe me, you won't be discredited just because you have red skin or something like that. I'm sure there will be much more serious reasons!

![Skin Color](images/R17C7.avif)

### Hairless

No body hair! Even if you're a damn minotaur or centaur or... It doesn't matter - at most, you can keep eyelashes and eyebrows. Well, okay, and a bit of hair on your head...

![Hairless](images/R17C8.avif)

### Extra Fur

Please, no hairy cyborgs... Actually, it's a great adaptation for northern latitudes, and the fur even changes color with the seasons, but... Are you sure?

![Extra Fur](images/R17C9.avif)

### Scales

A bit of scales? I'm not sure if that will be comfortable, especially if you choose the sharp version, as it can easily tear your clothes... But at least mosquitoes definitely won't bite you!

![Scales](images/R17C10.avif)

### Armor

By the way, you can actually just add extra armor - that will definitely help you in the new world! Look, it can't even be chopped with an axe, and bullets just ricochet off it!

![Armor](images/R17C11.avif)

### Spiky

And if you add even more spikes, they'll tear not only your clothes but also enemies who try to grab you... It'll be even more fun to smashing hordes of weak monsters!

![Spiky](images/R17C12.avif)

### Fangs

These teeth are perfect for biting necks or whatever you fancy. I mean, just looking at them will make anyone freeze in terror!

![Fangs](images/R17C13.avif)

### Skull Snappers

But why bite the neck when you can just bite off the head? I bet any victim will freeze and let you do whatever you want, just so you don't actually bite their head off!

![Skull Snappers](images/R17C14.avif)

### Venomous

Your saliva will be slightly poisonous, and you can even choose what kind of poison it is. The standard set includes sedatives, aphrodisiacs, hallucinogens...

![Venomous](images/R17C15.avif)

### Gas Warfare

Hey, no need to spit on me! If you want, there are much more effective ways to spread poison. Just a few more poison glands and you'll be like a living gas weapon!

![Gas Warfare](images/R17C16.avif)

### Long Tongue

Hmm? What if you already have a tentacle tongue? Oh, I don't know, then just don't choose this option? Or I could attach another one for you? Although usually, one is enough...

![Long Tongue](images/R17C17.avif)

### Squirm Pack

Ugh... okay-okay, I don't mind! A couple more? Maybe a dozen? Poisonous spikes? Okay! Done! Oh, I had to remove some unnecessary stuff from your head to fit them in, but you won't even notice...

![Squirm Pack](images/R17C18.avif)

### Mantis Maulers

These razor-sharp raptorial appendages will definitely help you in any fight. One swing, and you'll slice your enemy in half! I can even add extra joints like a praying mantis.

![Mantis Maulers](images/R17C19.avif)

### Paws

Okay, okay, a standard pair of paws, strong claws, four powerful fingers? Hey, it's not because four fingers are easier to draw; they'll have thicker bones and more muscles!

![Paws](images/R17C20.avif)

### Nimble Fingers

Hmm... Didn't I tell you we're creating a monster in this experiment? You should... Ah, forget it, there's not enough space and we need to hurry. Fine, regular fingers...

![Nimble Fingers](images/R17C21.avif)

### Retractable Blades

Maybe at least a pair of retractable blades, huh? Like that guy from Marvel, huh? I've always wanted to try replacing someone's skeleton... But for now, just claws!

![Retractable Blades](images/R17C22.avif)

### Stealthy Slicers

Are you sure about the raptorial appendages? I can just add them so they fold behind your back... no one will expect a sudden attack with six more blades!

![Stealthy Slicers](images/R17C23.avif)

### Monstrous Wings

Seriously, stop picking the most boring options in this poll! Maybe at least wings? Everyone likes to fly, right? You have to look like a monster or the experiment might fail! 

![Monstrous Wings](images/R17C24.avif)

### UltraVision

Or how about extra senses? That's a popular choice, isn't it? You can see ultraviolet, infrared, and even what's behind you! Just need to add more eyes...

![UltraVision](images/R17C25.avif)

### Monochrome

Uh-oh... Sorry, it seems your visual nerves are a bit overloaded, so you'll perceive everything in black and white... but there are so many shades! And you'll still see an expanded range!

![Monochrome](images/R17C26.avif)

### Feminine

Oh... Are you sure?
<div style="color: #9e2323;">Of course! Anons just love this!</div>Well... Okay? Then you'll look more feminine... somehow... Huh, actually it doesn't look that bad.

![Feminine](images/R17C27.avif)

### Boobs

<div style="color: #9e2323;">Just add big, juicy soft boobs and he'll be happy! I mean, boobs make everything better, right? Even monsters!</div> Fine...

![Boobs](images/R17C28.avif)

### Eldritch Tits

Maybe at least add some teeth? As long as the jaws are closed, they will be just as soft and bouncy, even better than normal!

![Eldritch Tits](images/R17C29.avif)

### Monster Cunt

Ugh... okay, okay, I get it... Whatever... Anyway, you'll probably learn to change your body later... At least this way you can switch between different sets of "tools".

![Monster Cunt](images/R17C30.avif)

### Crystal Core

Oh! Right, let's replace your entire skeleton with a crystalline one! It's practically indestructible and will even transform along with your body like normal bones!

![Crystal Core](images/R17C31.avif)

### Dark Wounds

There you go, now your body will be more thrifty and won't bleed out from wounds! Any injury will only tear your flesh, which will fuse back together in a matter of minutes!

![Dark Wounds](images/R17C32.avif)

### Regeneration

Well... You'll likely face tough battles and might lose some flesh... But with enhanced regeneration, it will grow back easily, as long as you have good nutrition!

![Regeneration](images/R17C33.avif)

### Reserve Organs

I'll duplicate all your vital organs several times... Yes, even your head, it's not that hard - all information will be distributed through the nervous system, plus a backup copy of your memories encoded directly into your DNA...

![Reserve Organs](images/R17C34.avif)

### Pain Suppression

Oh, sorry, I almost forgot! Usually, people don't handle minor injuries like losing a head very well... But now you'll be able to turn off unnecessary pain so it won't bother you!

![Pain Suppression](images/R17C35.avif)

### Eternal Youth

Yes, yes, true immortality! Or rather, "negligible aging" because you simply won't age after... hmmm... 25 years? Or maybe you prefer a different age?

![Eternal Youth](images/R17C36.avif)

### Bony Tail

Oh! I almost forgot! A tail! It's one of the most important distinguishing features of monsters! Scaly, fluffy... Um, what? That's already used? Oh... So... Bony?

![Bony Tail](images/R17C37.avif)

### Snake Tail

No, you're right, simple bony plates aren't quite fitting for a true monster... Maybe just a snake tail? With a tail like that, you won't even need legs!

![Snake Tail](images/R17C38.avif)

### Spider Tail

Right! Here it is - a real monster tail! Well... I guess the more accurate term here would be "lover body." But at least it looks amazing, right?

![Spider Tail](images/R17C39.avif)

### Octo Tail

A few more tentacles wouldn't hurt... Or rather, octopus tentacles with strong suction cups that will let you climb even glass ceilings. By the way, want a beak underneath?

![Octo Tail](images/R17C40.avif)

### Centipede Tail

If two or even eight legs aren't enough for you, I have a great offer! Will twenty pairs be enough? Or maybe add even more segments?

![Centipede Tail](images/R17C41.avif)

### Evolution

All right, that's enough... If you want, just take this and your body will change over the first few years so you can try different options and then choose what you like best.

![Evolution](images/R17C42.avif)

##  Monster Dick

<div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;">I think this should be enough.
<div style="color: #9e2323; text-align: right;">Hmm... no, something feels missing...
 Why are we even turning him into a monster?</div><div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;">Oh, haven't I told you my theory? 
I believe the Dark Gods only come to peaceful and prosperous worlds. And I know of one fantasy world that hasn't seen a single war in a thousand years. They don't even develop magic, and the knights only carry ceremonial sword handles, not wanting to bother with the weight of a real blade! It's all stagnation and boredom! According to my calculations, the Dark Gods should be showing up there soon to start their bloody harvest...</div><div style="color: #9e2323; text-align: right;">Wait... So you need a monster to...</div><div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;">Exactly! 
To beat them to the punch, shake up that stagnant world, and create some chaos! Of course, one monster, even a powerful one, won't be enough, but I'm counting on him reproducing very quickly. After all, you said that all Anons are very lustful and will happily mate with anyone if given the chance, right?</div>
<div style="color: #9e2323; text-align: right;">Hah, I think he'll definitely manage that! We just need to provide him with the right tool!</div>


### Meat Cannon

<div style="color: #9e2323;  ">I think what a monster needs most of all is a huge dick! Just gigantic! One that makes enemies tremble in fear at the mere sight of it, and victims think they'll be torn in half!</div>

![Meat Cannon](images/R18C1.avif)

### Terror Tower

<div style="color: #9e2323; ">No! The dick needs to be bigger! Even bigger! Ah! There it is, perfection! I haven't felt like a tiny fairy hugging a giant dick in ages! Mmm!!! Tear me apart! Tear me apart quickly!</div>

![Terror Tower](images/R18C2.avif)

### Horse

Hey, stop licking it! Control yourself, Succa, and stick to standard procedure! So, test subject 7947, would you like to have a horse penis?

![Horse](images/R18C3.avif)

### Big Knot

Actually, no, let's break it down... How about a knot like on a dog's dick? You'll even be able to consciously control its swelling.

![Big Knot](images/R18C4.avif)

### Flesh Spikes

Small fleshy spikes like on a cat's? They should stimulate any vagina perfectly; I just tested this on a group of subjects at a secret club...

![Flesh Spikes](images/R18C5.avif)

### Bony Spikes

<div style="color: #9e2323; ">Or even better - bony spikes! Now that's a true monster dick, each movement of which... </div> will bring special pleasure. No, no damage, the females must remain alive.

![Bony Spikes](images/R18C6.avif)

### Fire Hot

I can also raise the temperature of your member. I think a safe 60 degrees Celsius will be more than enough to make it feel blazing hot and stimulate blood flow in the vagina.

![Fire Hot](images/R18C7.avif)

### Grover

Your member will always be ridiculously tiny when not aroused. What? No, that's not a flaw, silly test subject! It's very convenient!

![Grover](images/R18C8.avif)

### Colossus

Okay, fine, your monster dick will always be huge, so it won't even fit in your pants! Is that better? Anyway, choose one of these two options!

![Colossus](images/R18C9.avif)

### Piercing

You'll always crave additional stimulation, so you'll insert various piercings into your cock. Oh no, not now, they'd be too expensive to transfer to the new world...

![Piercing](images/R18C10.avif)

### Buzzing

Your member will vibrate more powerfully than any vibrator you've ever seen! You can just insert it and not even move - orgasms guaranteed!

![Buzzing](images/R18C11.avif)

### Shocking

Alright, I think with this, anyone can drive a girl crazy with pleasure. It's literally electric stimulation of the most sensitive parts... Hey, Succa, get off it! I'm not done yet!

![Shocking](images/R18C12.avif)

### Tentacles

You can never have too many tentacles! A couple here, a couple there... Usually, the victim has several suitable holes, so you'll find places to stick them all!

![Tentacles](images/R18C13.avif)

### Autonomous

It's hard to control a bunch of tentacles, so it's better to add a nerve cluster to each one to give them autonomy... Oh, now they can handle impregnating someone all by themselves!

![Autonomous](images/R18C14.avif)

### Mindfuckers

Tiny tentacles that not only blink hypnotically but can literally burrow into the victim's head to mind-fuck them! Oh, this doesn't replace the main cock, it's just an addition!

![Mindfuckers](images/R18C15.avif)

### Multiple Dicks

Another member? Sure, no problem! That way, you can inseminate twice as many females, right? No, I don't think you can impregnate three at once - better use tentacles for that.

![Multiple Dicks](images/R18C16.avif)

### Flying Cock

Although, if you think about it... Yes, this problem can be solved! Flying members! Oh, why are you so surprised? You've probably seen this in hentai before, right? Five hours of autonomy should be enough...

![Flying Cock](images/R18C17.avif)

### Custom

Okay, hold on, I'll insert a probe... There you go, now if you want any other decorative details like a special color or shape, just think about it! Your member will be exactly as you imagine it!

![Custom](images/R18C18.avif)

### Standard Hentai Field

This standard hentai field allows you to insert anything into anyone without causing harm, only pleasure. I think it's better to set this up right away...

![Standard Hentai Field](images/R18C19.avif)

### All The Way

<div style="color: #9e2323; ">To hell with ordinary, boring biology! With the advanced hentai field, you can literally pierce girls with your dick all the way through! </div>

![All The Way](images/R18C20.avif)

### Mind Meld

Oh... Fine. Then what about literally fuck someone in the brain? Just don't use a penis that's bigger than the skull itself; hentai magic is already pushing its limits here...

![Mind Meld](images/R18C21.avif)

### Modify

Yes, yes, breasts, urethra, belly button, and other unconventional orifices... You can also modify them so they can accept any ordinary member later.

![Modify](images/R18C22.avif)

### Virgin Tight

If you want, every hole will be virgin tight for you! As soon as you pull out, it will instantly restore, and the next thrust will feel like the first!

![Virgin Tight](images/R18C23.avif)

### Ruined

Okay, if that doesn't interest you, we can save some energy. Now, any hole you fuck will become an open gape, and no ordinary member will ever satisfy them again.

![Ruined](images/R18C24.avif)

### Cum Tsunami

You'll produce an insane amount of semen, literally several liters at a time, so your victims will be practically inflated with it. It might get a bit messy, but...

![Cum Tsunami](images/R18C25.avif)

### Super Tasty

<div style="color: #9e2323; ">But it will be super tasty! Oh, this is the best reward any slut can get for a good fuck! Mmm, let me try it myself... Hey, Mimmi, don't interrupt me, we need to test this thoroughly to... to set it up perfectly! </div>

![Super Tasty](images/R18C26.avif)

### Addicted

Hey, stop! No need to enhance it further, or it might cause an overdose and addiction! <div style="color: #9e2323; ">Mmm... Aaahhh, yeah... More~ Ah, you always have the best toys in your department~ Hic!</div>

![Addicted](images/R18C27.avif)

### Rape Time

This is a very simple upgrade - as soon as you insert your penis, the victim will completely stop resisting and let you use them as much as you want, even if they have a weapon in their hands.

![Rape Time](images/R18C28.avif)

### Glued

The girl just won't be able to get off your dick. At most, she'll be able to get up until only the head is left inside. You can mock and say she can go, but her body will betray her and won't let go of your cock until you cum.

![Glued](images/R18C29.avif)

### Mana Drain

Okay, while Succa is knocked out, I'll add you the ability to drain mana instead of feeding those stupid succubi, or they'll be chasing you in hordes even in another world...

![Mana Drain](images/R18C30.avif)

### Hole Detector

Your dick will always be rock hard if there's a suitable fuck hole nearby. You can even use it as a detector, as it will stand up even if a squad of ninja heroines is sneaking up on you!

![Hole Detector](images/R18C31.avif)

### Musk

Your cock will have a special, intoxicating scent made up of a complex mix of pheromones and aphrodisiacs. Any girl will instantly get turned on the moment she smells it and will be eagerly inhaling that scent again and again.

![Musk](images/R18C32.avif)

### Hygiene Problems

I'm afraid you'll develop a bad habit of never washing your member and balls... But I don't think that will be a problem, because why bother when you can just get some bitch to lick it clean, right?

![Hygiene Problems](images/R18C33.avif)

### Irresistible

Your dick will be so phenomenally good that girls that have tried it at least once will absolutely not care about your appearance and who you are, and they will be ready to literally marry your dick. 

![Irresistible](images/R18C34.avif)

### Loyalty

Once enjoyed your cock girls will subconsciously save their pussy only for you. Even if they have a boyfriend and hate anal they will always ask him to fuck them in the ass.

![Loyalty](images/R18C35.avif)

### Up to the Balls

Since our goal is insemination, not a pretty bukkake, you won't be able to come until you insert your cock all the way to the balls. Yes, determining that it's actually a vagina isn't that easy, but... oh well.

![Up to the Balls](images/R18C36.avif)

### Cum Balloons

Maybe I went a bit overboard, because your balls will continuously produce semen and grow in size... And you'll only be able to release it into a suitable hole... Oops!

![Cum Balloons](images/R18C37.avif)

### Grotesque

Ugh... Well... Yeah, maybe your member isn't the prettiest... Actually, it's so disgusting and revolting that it might make someone puke just by looking at it... But it's a monster dick, so that's okay, right?

![Grotesque](images/R18C38.avif)

### Will Breaker

But with this thing, it'll be much easier to break your victims' will! Just a couple of days of rape and they'll consider themselves defiled and unworthy of anything better than being a breeding sow for monsters!

![Will Breaker](images/R18C39.avif)

### No Solo

Masturbation will feel completely empty and meaningless for you. The penis doesn't even get hard if there's no one here to really fuck.

![No Solo](images/R18C40.avif)

### Lubeless

You won't produce any lubrication at all, but, mmm, is that really your problem? It won't stop the insemination, so let the girls worry about that...

![Lubeless](images/R18C41.avif)

### Virility

You possess supernatural fertility, allowing you to impregnate women by inducing ovulation at any time. Every shot will be a hit!

![Virility](images/R18C42.avif)

### Universal Compatibility

You could get anyone pregnant. I guess if you really try hard enough, you could even create stone golems by fucking a mountain... Okay, well, at least there won't be a problem with living things! 

![Universal Compatibility](images/R18C43.avif)

### Ovary Overhaul

Once you fill a girl's womb with your sperm, you'll change her ovaries a bit, so her next 5 kids will be monsters! It can be changed to forever, but this way she'll have an incentive to give birth to monsters sooner!

![Ovary Overhaul](images/R18C44.avif)

### Accelerated Pregnancy

By the way, quick births are incredibly convenient! So all the girls will give birth to your offspring in just a month, and if you keep filling them with energy, it could be as quick as a week!

![Accelerated Pregnancy](images/R18C45.avif)

### Litters

Rather than a singular spawn being birthed with each pregnancy, they occur in litters of three to five. It could be even more, depending on the size of the womb!

![Litters](images/R18C46.avif)

### Ovipositor

In my opinion, an ovipositor is a much more reliable solution; mimics use them all the time. But... you'll have to spend a lot more resources, as the female will just be an incubator...

![Ovipositor](images/R18C47.avif)

### Parasites

But there's an improved version! These little parasitic larvae can feed on the female's fluids and develop independently! And you can lay them by the hundreds without getting tired!

![Parasites](images/R18C48.avif)

## 



### Blink



![Blink]()

## Drawbacks

<div style="color: #9e2323; text-align: right;">Oh, Mimmi, look!</div><div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;"> Hm? What? Sorry, I got a bit distracted with the settings.</div><div style="color: #9e2323; text-align: right;">He's blinking again!</div><div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;"> Um... Yes? Isn't that just a natural reflex for humans?</div><div style="color: #9e2323; text-align: right;">No way, I can tell he did it on purpose! I'm telling you - he wants something!</div><div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;"> No, Succa, two incidents in one day is already too many!
 I'm not removing his paralysis just to ask what he wants. 
What if he tries to break free and escape?</div><div style="color: #9e2323; text-align: right;">Oh, don't worry, it's just Anon! 
They usually have pretty simple desires that are easy to guess. 
Power, sex, you know...</div><div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;"> Need I remind you, I just conducted a survey about superpowers and his giant monster penis?
Besides, I can't keep improving this test subject's body indefinitely - it simply won't hold up. 
And I'll run out of energy.</div><div style="color: #9e2323; text-align: right;">Uh... well... Then... Maybe we could simplify something instead? 
Trust me, this one would actually enjoy some amusing drawbacks!</div>


### Always Naked

Well, I suppose we could find better uses for certain parts of his brain... Like this one that handles wearing clothes. Besides, it's perfectly normal for monsters to go around naked!

![Always Naked](images/R20C1.avif)

### Split

A minor split personality shouldn't bother you too much... Just a few different voices in your head, I'm sure you'll even become friends with them!

![Split](images/R20C2.avif)

### Sick Days

One week a year you'll have a fever, shrink to half your size and lose 3/4 of your strength. Better just lie under a blanket, put off conquering the world for later.

![Sick Days](images/R20C3.avif)

### Dark Humor

Monster life is rough, so your psyche will seek refuge in humor. Very, very dark and cruel humor. But hey, it's all good as long as you're having fun, right?

![Dark Humor](images/R20C4.avif)

### Terror Incarnate

You're a monster, and your mere presence will terrify people. Even if you just walk up and say "hi," they'll probably scream and run away.

![Terror Incarnate](images/R20C5.avif)

### Fear Fetish

A normal person might find such reactions unpleasant, but you... Well, you're a monster. You'll get off on their terror, always finding new and creative ways to scare them.

![Fear Fetish](images/R20C6.avif)

### Pure Evil

Anyone who sees you won't doubt for a second that you're pure evil incarnate. They'll believe any means are justified against you, so even the most peaceful and honest person won't hesitate to stab you in the back.

![Pure Evil](images/R20C7.avif)

### Nasty Rumour

In this new world, people will always spread the most disgusting and vile stories about you, and everyone will believe you're a horrible monster who eats children, no matter what you actually do.

![Nasty Rumour](images/R20C8.avif)

### Ancient Lore

Surprisingly, this world already has legends about a monster exactly like you... Oddly enough, many of your weaknesses are common knowledge even among children...

![Ancient Lore](images/R20C9.avif)

### Girls Only

By the way, they think they've decoded an ancient prophecy saying no man can defeat you. So you'll only be hunted by brave heroines. They're not men, right?

![Girls Only](images/R20C10.avif)

### Fading Memories

I don't think your consciousness can fully accept this new form... Well... Never mind, let's just make you gradually forget your past life and this world. It'll be much easier that way!

![Fading Memories](images/R20C11.avif)

### Lazy Destroyer

You're more of a sprinter than a marathon runner - you can fight at full power for only a few hours a day, then you'll get terribly lazy. You'll just want to lie around, drink beer, watch TV...

![Lazy Destroyer](images/R20C12.avif)

### Lonely at the Top

Despite all the thousands of girls you'll fuck, armies of monsters you'll command and everything else, you'll always be alone. Oh... I'll adjust your mind so you'll get used to it eventually.

![Lonely at the Top](images/R20C13.avif)

### Worthy Opponent

One day you'll meet someone who truly understands you - your sworn enemy. Just as powerful, just as brilliant, and just as misunderstood by their surroundings. You'll both deeply regret being enemies.

![Worthy Opponent](images/R20C14.avif)

### Awkward Moments

Knights, adventurers, and other heroes will always attack at the most inconvenient moments. Sometimes it'll be so awkward they'll even close the door themselves to let you put your pants on first.

![Awkward Moments](images/R20C15.avif)

### True Name

Due to the succubus power that revived you, you'll always obey anyone who knows your true name. Ugh... How does she even live with this? No, I'll weaken the effect so you can at least escape after a month...

![True Name](images/R20C16.avif)

### Limb Tax

Interdimensional travel is very complex and energy-intensive. It'll be much easier if I reduce mass by cutting off your arm... You did take regeneration, right? Then no worries - it'll grow back!

![Limb Tax](images/R20C17.avif)

### Disposable Parts

Oh, looks like your new limbs will be a bit less durable... They'll often get chopped off in battle, bitten off, burned, crushed... But if you survive, you can always grow new ones! Just imagine you're a lizard.

![Disposable Parts](images/R20C18.avif)

### Gluttony

Your new body will require way, way more energy, so a couple of burgers a day definitely won't cut it. You'll be devouring dozens of pounds of meat daily or something like that!

![Gluttony](images/R20C19.avif)

### Favorite Meal

The sweetest, most desirable food for you will be humans. And the younger and prettier, the better... That even sounds horrible... but hey, just giving them a good lick will be enough to satisfy you!

![Favorite Meal](images/R20C20.avif)

### Scary Face

Even in your "human" form, you'll always be one scary-looking bastard. Trust me, doing anything about it would be damn hard - even simple illusions won't help here.

![Scary Face](images/R20C21.avif)

### Pierced Freak

However... I think you could use additional devices to somewhat correct this issue. It'll still look strange, but you'll come across more as a very weird freak than a monster.

![Pierced Freak](images/R20C22.avif)

### Beauty Routine

Fine, fine, quality alchemy and face masks might actually help you out. I'll even share some good recipes, but you'll still need to spend at least an hour daily maintaining it.

![Beauty Routine](images/R20C23.avif)

### Rage Reveal

Keep in mind that if you get genuinely angry, all your disguise will instantly vanish! That gentle human face will transform back into a horrible mug in just seconds!

![Rage Reveal](images/R20C24.avif)

### Narcissism

Not the best personality trait, but it'll help you adapt to your new body faster. Spending hours admiring yourself in mirrors is just a minor side effect...

![Narcissism](images/R20C25.avif)

### Sweet Dreams

Oh, you don't mind? Well then, I'll remove some mental barriers... Don't worry, you won't hate yourself - you'll just have many more vivid nightmares.

![Sweet Dreams](images/R20C26.avif)

### Rape Only

Girls will always cry during sex with you, resist, and beg you to let them go. Even if you pay them well or they come willingly, so just ignore it and do your thing...

![Rape Only](images/R20C27.avif)

### Gentleman

Let me help you... now even when you think you're being incredibly gentle and kind, you'll actually be ruthlessly raping those meat holes. Remember, we need lots of new monsters!

![Gentleman](images/R20C28.avif)

### Crybaby

When you finally toss aside the unconscious body of a girl after several hours of hot rape, you might temporarily feel your old compassion and start crying and apologizing.

![Crybaby](images/R20C29.avif)

### Friendly

It's always better with friends, right? At least you won't be jealous at all and will gladly invite other monsters to share the pleasure and use all the available holes!

![Friendly](images/R20C30.avif)

### Safe Word

You will always provide your captives with a safe word that will make you stop raping them and let them go. I mean, if they don't say it, it means they like it and it's all consensual, right?

![Safe Word](images/R20C31.avif)

### Paranoid

Paranoia is only a weakness during peaceful times - which you won't have anyway! The more you look over your shoulder and check for traps, the longer you'll live!

![Paranoid](images/R20C32.avif)

### Curiosity

In your new world, you'll have incredible curiosity, always exploring the most hidden places like a cat. Sometimes you'll even test traps, dungeons, and cursed items yourself!

![Curiosity](images/R20C33.avif)

### Risk Appetite

This will definitely come in handy! You'll become a true adrenaline maniac, savoring every second of danger and adventure! Each challenge will only fuel your excitement!

![Risk Appetite](images/R20C34.avif)

### Alcoholic Escape

Alcohol is a proven way to forget anything... And since your new liver can handle any amount of drinks, I'm afraid you'll soon become a heavy alcoholic...

![Alcoholic Escape](images/R20C35.avif)

### Junkie

Well... unless you find something stronger... Sigh... I'm afraid it'll happen eventually. At least try not to use anything too strong before battles, okay?

![Junkie](images/R20C36.avif)

### Rage

You will have a very hard time controlling your emotions, especially your rage. Actually, I wouldn't call this a disadvantage, as often the additional hormones will help you in battle...

![Rage](images/R20C37.avif)

### Berserk

Once you taste blood, you won't be able to stop until you've torn apart everyone within reach. Better warn your soldiers to run away right before victory!

![Berserk](images/R20C38.avif)

### Ultaviolence

You will be inhumanly cruel, and the sight of others' suffering, blood, and death will only entertain you. You will always try to create a real bloody spectacle on the battlefield.

![Ultaviolence](images/R20C39.avif)

### Warmonger

You'll be terribly bored during peacetime and prefer to start wars even when victory isn't certain. Yes, I'll add some energy for this trait - it'll help the experiment!

![Warmonger](images/R20C40.avif)

### Eternal War

War is too much fun for you! So much that even after winning, you'll often leave enemies alone to recover just so you can attack again! Oh, how that will annoy everyone!

![Eternal War](images/R20C41.avif)

### Monster with a Heart

You may be a monster, but you're not... uh... THAT kind of monster? I mean, you won't actually eat children, right? I'll install a mental block to prevent that... don't worry, enemies won't dare use this against you.

![Monster with a Heart](images/R20C42.avif)

## Some Bonuses



### Brain Boost

Hmm... actually, I think we've freed up enough space and can use these sections of the brain... oh... Maybe I should just add a little IQ, so the first hero doesn't outsmart you?

![Brain Boost](images/R21C1.avif)

### Quick Study

How about rapid learning? You can read a book in minutes, and your brain will process it overnight! You can even skim through a small library in one evening, then gradually understand it all.

![Quick Study](images/R21C2.avif)

### Tech Savvy

Some mechanical knowledge won't hurt. I mean, you already know a lot, we just need to awaken your memories... Oh... well, I guess I'll just upload the information...

![Tech Savvy](images/R21C3.avif)

### Spidey Senses

You'll have danger sense like a real Spider-Man! What? Oh yes, I was experimenting with recreating him recently... So now there are several six-armed freaks in red pajamas running around the city...

![Spidey Senses](images/R21C4.avif)

### Sleeping Beauty

You love sleep so much that you'll never be able to strike or even wake a sleeping person. Instead of ambushing sleeping heroes, you'll always wait until morning. But they'll be waiting too!

![Sleeping Beauty](images/R21C5.avif)

### Gambling Spirit

You're incredibly prone to gambling and will readily bet your last pants or a year of slavery. And it seems contagious - you can convince even your enemies to settle things with a dice roll!

![Gambling Spirit](images/R21C6.avif)

### Command and Conquer

This will definitely help if you don't plan to spend your new life hiding in wild forests! Leadership skills, ability to inspire armies and unite wild monsters!

![Command and Conquer](images/R21C7.avif)

### Fearless

You won't experience normal fear or panic, always able to assess any situation clearly. Like when a player controls a character in a game.

![Fearless](images/R21C8.avif)

### Manipulator

You'll have an extraordinary understanding of human motives, desires, and fears. Pushing them toward desired actions will be as simple as outsmarting a child!

![Manipulator](images/R21C9.avif)

### Jack of All Trades

I'll try to distribute and fill the free areas evenly, so you'll master dozens of different skills and easily learn new ones, but only slightly above average level.

![Jack of All Trades](images/R21C10.avif)

### Hidden Talent

Or I can give you true talent, but only in one thing! Oh, no need to decide now - when you become seriously interested in something in the new world, this part of your brain will activate on its own!

![Hidden Talent](images/R21C11.avif)

### Growing Power

Hmm... I think... yes, I can make your brain continue to improve. Every 10 years you'll gain another talent or all your numerous skills will improve by 9%.

![Growing Power](images/R21C12.avif)

## 



### Blink



![Blink]()

## Gear

<div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;">Again? 
Stop blinking already! 
That's it, I can't enhance this body any further!</div><div style="color: #9e2323; text-align: right;">But Mimmi, 
he's got a whole new life ahead in another world, of course he wants to get stronger! 
Think about it - he'll be all alone there, with so many enemies waiting...</div><div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;">Hey, he's literally an overpowered monster-rapist I'm sending to the most peaceful, stagnant world I could find!
And trust me, his instincts won't let him stay 'alone' for long!</div><div style="color: #9e2323; text-align: right;">But... Just look at those pleading eyes and all that blinking! 
You're super smart, I'm sure you can figure something out!</div><div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;">Ugh... Fine... Maybe I could give him some equipment? 
But this is the last time, got it?
 Blink one more time and I'm taping those eyes shut!</div>
 

### Nano Armor

A rather silly nano-armor that only knows how to deflect enemy attacks, transform into weapons, and patch up its wearer's wounds when needed. Hmm, I wonder what would happen if we put it on a symbiote?

![Nano Armor](images/R23C1.avif)

### Tranquilliser

No, no flying syringes! This device creates a powerful psi-discharge that temporarily shuts down any nervous system or electronics within 5 meters of impact. Oh, fine, I'll add protection for you just in case...

![Tranquilliser](images/R23C2.avif)

### Finger-Gun

A bone plate that creates simple magic arrows on its own. Just draw the rune of your desired element here and make a finger gun. 50 shots, usually recharges itself daily, but you can feed it energy yourself.

![Finger-Gun](images/R23C3.avif)

### Orbital Strike

A combat satellite will be sent along with you. It's a compact model, so it'll need about a year to find and prepare an asteroid for attack, but once ready, it can obliterate an entire army on your command!

![Orbital Strike](images/R23C4.avif)

### Gravity Gloves

An upgraded version of gravity gloves! Now you can not only disarm enemies but throw them around too! Or move about 20 tons of cargo. Really handy during construction.

![Gravity Gloves](images/R23C5.avif)

### Noble Mask

An elegant porcelain mask adorned with gold and precious gems, complete with an exquisite suit to conceal your monstrous form. Everyone will see you as just an eccentric aristocrat.

![Noble Mask](images/R23C6.avif)

### Battle Bitches

No idea why you'd need Battle Bitches in this world, but I have to offer you the standard one-year contract with them. Each one is incredibly dangerous, but remember - they're either fighting or fucking!

![Battle Bitches](images/R23C7.avif)

### Guardian Angel

A skilled mercenary who'll always save your ass in the most dangerous moments. Though she's quite lazy and will only take a couple shots before running off again. Or she might toss you a rocket launcher - I still don't know where she hides it under that dress...

![Guardian Angel](images/R23C8.avif)

### Defense Turret

Standard autonomous combat turrets. Oh, don't be surprised - this batch was made for a steampunk world, that's why they look like that. They work exactly the same, just talk with a Victorian accent and make gear-clicking noises!

![Defense Turret](images/R23C9.avif)

### Waifu

Fine, fine, so you won't be lonely in the new world, you can order one waifu. No, no stable supplies or brainwashing - I don't have time for that! You'll have to deal with her yourself!

![Waifu](images/R23C10.avif)

### Sex Note

With this cursed notebook, you just need to write someone's name and how they should have sex, and it'll happen. Even you should be able to handle that, right? Hmm... I better write the rules right on the cover, just in case.

![Sex Note](images/R23C11.avif)

### Spell Book

A regular dark mage's spell book. It'll automatically record all spells and rituals you learn, maps, events, quests, etc. You can even store it in the astral plane and summon it with a quick gesture.

![Spell Book](images/R23C12.avif)

### Smoke

You probably won't find your usual cigarettes, coffee, or whatever you're addicted to in the new world, so we'll set up supplies for you. This should help you relax and feel at home.

![Smoke](images/R23C13.avif)

### Pizza Delivery

Oh right, why do this myself when I can just order pizza from MazeShop... Hold on, let me pay for your thousand-year subscription... Huh? Oh no, I don't have time to make you a full account!

![Pizza Delivery](images/R23C14.avif)

### Game Console

Oh, don't look at me like that! And don't you dare blink again! Here, just take this gaming console. With this and pizza, you'll feel at home in any cave, if Succa's right about anons.

![Game Console](images/R23C15.avif)

### Daily Gold

You'll probably need to buy stuff in the new world... Well... Unless you decide to take everything by force. Anyway, here's a purse. 50 gold pieces daily should be enough for anyone!

![Daily Gold](images/R23C16.avif)

### 3d Printer

Or you could just make whatever you need in your dirty cave. This 3D printer will help! Just grind the base components into fine powder and connect the power - it'll do the rest itself.

![3d Printer](images/R23C17.avif)

### Portal Stones

A dozen portal stones that work within the same world and can transport up to 7 people at once. Also has an "escape" function for quick teleportation along with the stone itself.

![Portal Stones](images/R23C18.avif)

### Iron Mimic

This young mimic eats too much iron, probably why it acts so goofy... It even forgets to hide its legs when transforming! But damn, it's tough! Take care of it, okay?

![Iron Mimic](images/R23C19.avif)

### Bone Fairy

This fairy has an unexpectedly strong fetish for bones and creepy stuff. Maybe she thinks she looks even prettier next to them? Anyway, she's been annoying me with pleas to find her a necromancer or monster...

![Bone Fairy](images/R23C20.avif)

### Mutagen

Here, a dozen mutagen injections. Useless for you now, but you can turn someone else into a monster. Of course, without my help, the process will be completely random, but still.

![Mutagen](images/R23C21.avif)

### Panacea

Each of these pills completely heals all injuries, diseases, and rejuvenates to age 20. No, not magical curses, mutations, and your modifications. They're actually pretty cheap, so I'll give you several packs...

![Panacea](images/R23C22.avif)

### MCV

Mobile Construction Vehicle, slow but quite convenient base with lots of built-in tools. It even floats! Unfortunately, without spice or a powerful energy source, you can't deploy it into a full base, but you'll figure something out.

![MCV](images/R23C23.avif)

### Zipped Castle

Every dark lord needs their gloomy gothic castle, but they usually take years to build... So here's an archived version. Just find a suitable spot and press the button to make it expand to full size!

![Zipped Castle](images/R23C24.avif)

### Blink-Blink



![Blink-Blink]()

##  Destination

<div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;">Hey, this isn't funny anymore! I warned you, didn't I? 
Though I think you'll do just fine without eyes if we attach antennae like insects...</div><div style="color: #9e2323; text-align: right;">Mimmi, wait! He... uh... 
This is probably...</div><div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;">Natural reflex? No way - you were right: he's doing this on purpose! 
This time he even blinked twice!</div><div style="color: #9e2323; text-align: right;">Well... Uhh... Maybe... 
Maybe he's just really eager to get to the new world! 
He's just burning with anticipation!</div><div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;">Oh! You're right! 
With all these surveys, I almost forgot we need to send him quickly! 
Okay, one last choice before we send you through the portal!</div>


### Forgotten Treasury

I'll find you some beautiful deserted place like forgotten ruins with a secret chamber full of ancient treasures. Yes, I think this would make an ideal starting point.

![Forgotten Treasury](images/R25C1.avif)

### Kinda Safe

Well, any uninhabited place would work just fine. Some forest or fields? I don't know, I'll just make sure there's no army or dangerous swamps nearby, okay?

![Kinda Safe](images/R25C2.avif)

### Random

Feeling lucky? Hah, well fine, I'll just input random coordinates. After all, there aren't that many places where you'd die instantly, so everything should be fine. Probably.

![Random](images/R25C3.avif)

### Light City

The dark lord's arrival shouldn't go unnoticed, so you'll appear right in front of the central cathedral in the kingdom's capital. Better start running before they come to their senses!

![Light City](images/R25C4.avif)

### Orbital Flares

Yes, yes, I know monsters are often dropped into the new world like space marines... A lone star is beautiful, but if you want, I can add more meteors to make your landing spot harder to find.

![Orbital Flares](images/R25C5.avif)

### Dark Omen

Mmm... no, I suppose your arrival will be too obvious anyway, since it'll coincide with a total eclipse... And a black tornado... Hah, well, I guess it's just a coincidence!

![Dark Omen](images/R25C6.avif)

## Departure

<div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;">Finally, let's get you to the portal... Oh, those blood stains? Just a little scientific mishap... And please ignore the scales in the corner... And the occult candles... 
Hm, looks like I really need to clean this lab after I'm done with you.</div><div style="color: #9e2323; text-align: right;">Don't worry, Anon, it's always fun in the new world!</div><div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;">Yes, if he survived the transfer...</div><div style="color: #9e2323; text-align: right;">Oh come on, I've done this like a thousand times!</div><div style="color: #d5ceb5; text-align: left;">I wouldn't exactly compare succubi, who evolved specifically for interdimensional travel, to this... well, whatever. You're right - no need to scare our test subject. Bad for the data. So, please, just ignore those warning sirens and focus on arriving mostly intact!</div><div style="color: #9e2323; text-align: right;">Bye-bye!</div>

### Disappear



![Disappear]()

## New World

<div style="color: #9e2323;">Hi there!!

Huh, finally caught up with you... 
Hold up, you seriously thought I'd stay behind in that lab with Mimmi? 
Please tell me you didn't think that was the end? 
Like "monster created, thanks for playing"? 
I didn't hit you with a truck just for that!
Er... 
I mean, the fun's just getting started! 
Who's gonna host this CYOA if I stay back there? 
You? Ha, please, Anon...
So of course I'm here!

What? Why aren't the paladins of light hunting you down yet? 
Oh gods, did you even read the intro? 
This world hasn't seen war in centuries;
 they haven't fought anyone and can't even imagine you're a monster. 
Look, that one's even trying to bless you, thinking you're just sick or something! 
Which means we've got plenty of time to have some fun!

Soo~ let's make some ba~ad choices, my sweet monster!</div>


### Good Deeds

Um, wait, where are you going? What do you mean you need to save a kitten from a tree?! I just said you need to do bad things! Hey, you're a monster! A future Dark Lord! Get down from that tree right now, I didn't raise you like this!

![Good Deeds](images/R27C1.avif)

### Gourmet's Quest

Try all the tastiest dishes in the kingdom? Ugh, do I have to run around like a waitress again and bring you dishes from every tavern? Oh well, at least fantasy worlds do have great food... But actually, you could have just come in Succubus café!

![Gourmet's Quest](images/R27C2.avif)

### Dark Delicacies

Oh! That's what you're talking about! Yeah, you won't find that in my café... Although something tells me you haven't corrupted this world enough to order a slave soup... And I won't cook it for you, girls are much tastier when they're alive!

![Dark Delicacies](images/R27C3.avif)

### Popularizer

Speaking of corrupting this world - they're all so innocent and sweet here... While they still don't know what they're dealing with, we could easily popularize your favorite kinks! How about some sexy maids? Pretty soon, every aristocrat will have them!

![Popularizer](images/R27C4.avif)

### Contract Master

Ah! Sinister dark contracts! They don't believe in those yet! So we need to make as many contracts as possible! Look, he's not even reading the contract, thinking it's just a useless piece of paper! Haha!! Hey, who wants to use my ass in exchange for a signature? Get in line!

![Contract Master](images/R27C5.avif)

### Cursed Commerce

Or we could start selling cursed artifacts disguised as trendy jewelry! Don't worry, mysterious scary dudes always sell them, no one will be surprised that you're hiding your face! What? You don't know how to make them? Fine, I'll help you...

![Cursed Commerce](images/R27C6.avif)

### Drug Dealer

Oh, I definitely know how to make easy money! Drugs! There aren't any here, so we won't have any competition, and at first, everyone will think it's just an innocent hobby, haha!

![Drug Dealer](images/R27C7.avif)

### Rock 'n' Roll

Ugh, people lie when they say the devil invented rock, but if you want the modern youth to rebel a bit, that's the way to go! Sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll, baby!

![Rock 'n' Roll](images/R27C8.avif)

### Sexual Revolution

Sex! That's right, these silly puritan peasants need more sex! I'll teach them how to throw the wildest parties and enjoy every cock, every hole! Free love is what will save the world!

![Sexual Revolution](images/R27C9.avif)

### Armed Bandits

Oh, uh... Sorry, I got a bit carried away, we're supposed to cause chaos in this world, not a sex party... You remember how to make guns, right? I think if you start selling them to bandits, the knights will be very unpleasantly surprised.

![Armed Bandits](images/R27C10.avif)

### Crime Boss

Hmm... Wait, there are hardly any bandits here? What kind of world is this?! Oh, never mind, then it will be easier for you to create your own gang! Maybe even a whole criminal network! I'll even make you a stylish mob boss hat!

![Crime Boss](images/R27C11.avif)

### Caravan Raider

To build an empire of evil, you'll need resources, and the caravans are currently traveling without any guards! Just a dozen lazy carters who could be defeated even by a goblin! Just make sure to hide it all well!

![Caravan Raider](images/R27C12.avif)

### Dairy

Hey, let's open a "milk" shop in the capital for fun! Of course, it's a bit of a shame to sell such delicious stuff, but I think a monster like you is tough enough to feed both me and the local nobles! Just imagine their faces when they finally realize, haha!

![Dairy](images/R27C13.avif)

### Cute Pets

Ahaha! They actually think it's just a new cute pet! Wow! It's even become popular? Hey, they're just pretending, but at night they're having fun with them, right? Or they're in for a big surprise, because there are already hundreds of them in the city!

![Cute Pets](images/R27C14.avif)

### Battle Hamsters

Looks like they're getting suspicious; anti-evil amulets are becoming popular... Ah, whatever, they're so naive! I think there's still time to convince them that battle hamsters are the best defense against demons!

![Battle Hamsters](images/R27C15.avif)

### Rumor Mill

Maybe you want me to spread a couple of dirty rumors? Why? Pfft, who knows? But damn, they believe everything so easily... Maybe tell them how the queen sucks off the gardener? Or that the princess throws orgies at night?

![Rumor Mill](images/R27C16.avif)

### Monster Rapist

Oh, yeah!! I was wondering when you'd give in! Fucking bitches is exactly what a monster should do! Just catch them at night and rape them with all your might! By the way, want to practice a bit while it's still light? I'd be happy to help you with that~

![Monster Rapist](images/R27C17.avif)

### Catching Slaves

Oh, another one? Welcome, bitch! But, Anon, are you sure you should be catching slaves right now? I mean, where are we going to keep them? Of course, have fun and breed, but I'm not going to clean up after them or walk them!

![Catching Slaves](images/R27C18.avif)

### Slave Trade

Sell them? I think just stealing money would be easier, but it will definitely help corrupt society! Just make sure to explain to the new owners that they shouldn't pity the bitches and definitely shouldn't let them go home when they ask!

![Slave Trade](images/R27C19.avif)

### Training

Oh, right! Better practice breaking and training heroines right now! I mean, it would be very awkward if they end up being more experienced than you in this and start laughing at your attempts to torture them with your dick, right?

![Training](images/R27C20.avif)

### General Gambit

Wow! Looks like you're taking this seriously! That's right, no one needs the position of general right now, especially since the pay is small, and by the time they realize it, you'll have ruined their entire army and learned all their weaknesses from the inside!

![General Gambit](images/R27C21.avif)

### Seducer

Hah, want to show off your devilish charm and seduce some princess? Well, vampires usually do a great job at that... In your case... well... give it a try? Maybe pheromones will help? But I don't think Mimmi even considered this...

![Seducer](images/R27C22.avif)

### Blackmail

Yeah! Just break into her room at night and rape her, take a bunch of photos and threaten to expose her! Haha! It's been so long since anyone blackmailed princesses, I've missed this fun! Maybe make her wear toys? I have a couple just for that!

![Blackmail](images/R27C23.avif)

### Princess Puppet

Oh, you're truly a dark lord~ Raping and corrupting the princess every day and helping her become queen by eliminating all competitors! So cunning! That way, even during the war, you can continue tormenting her and make her lick your balls!

![Princess Puppet](images/R27C24.avif)

### Mana Sources

Oh, I almost forgot - you're completely new to world domination... There are barely any mages here, which means almost all natural mana sources are still unclaimed! We must find them so you can quickly replenish your energy!

![Mana Sources](images/R27C25.avif)

### Sacred Studies

Study the local religion? Are you seriously worried about those silly prophecies? Well, okay, I know where we can catch a pretty nun! I'm sure we can persuade her to share all the secrets in just a couple of nights!

![Sacred Studies](images/R27C26.avif)

### Cult Leader

By the way, let's create our own cult! Don't worry, gods rarely get offended by such jokes! I'll just teach them a couple of funny rejuvenation rituals! You know, a little orgy in nature, magic mushrooms, lots of dicks... very good for health!

![Cult Leader](images/R27C27.avif)

### Dark Mess

Wait, where... where did you learn that? What do you mean "it just came to mind"? That was a real black mass! I was just trying to joke! Oh, maybe I shouldn't have given you those mushrooms, but how was I to know they...

![Dark Mess](images/R27C28.avif)

### Whispers

worship... so easy... void waits... a small offering... infinite strength... points? ...do you crave points, fiend? ...take, take all you can... drink our power... taste our blood... prepare this realm... accept... ritual... tear it open...

![Whispers](images/R27C29.avif)

### Witches

#0a

![Witches](images/R27C30.avif)

### Library

Hmm... The library? Oh, I haven't been in one for a hundred years... Or two hundreds? But yeah, it's probably a good idea to just read the entire history of this world and learn everything without dealing with people... but damn boring, so I'm out!

![Library](images/R27C31.avif)

### Tentacles

By the way, Mimmi gave me a few tentacle monsters... Oh, right, I already tried to sell them... Anyway, it doesn't matter! I'll scatter them around here, okay? I mean - any fantasy is better with tentacles, right?

![Tentacles](images/R27C32.avif)

### Paralysing Traps

Look, there are even modern Japanese pitfall traps here! This monster completely paralyzes the body underground and rapes the victim for hours, so they experience all the accumulated orgasms at once! Can I lay here for a couple of days, plz?

![Paralysing Traps](images/R27C33.avif)

### Frienly Mimics

Of course, she slipped in a couple of mimics... These sneaky creatures only pretend to be monsters, but they actually help adventurers! It doesn't just rape, it restores their strength and heals wounds! Hmm... Wait, but then they'll come to them themselves...

![Frienly Mimics](images/R27C34.avif)

### "Resurrection"

By the way! It's very important to enchant all the monsters and your offspring from the very beginning! Defeated and fucked heroines should be taken to the "Resurrection Stone", not eaten! Let them think spirits saved them while they carry on your legacy!

!["Resurrection"](images/R27C35.avif)

## Trainings

<div style="color: #9e2323;">Phew!! We almost got caught!
Those paladins and other heroes are getting suspicious, huh?
It's weird, I thought we'd have at least a year of carefree fun...
Anyway, Anon, I think we forgot something...
I mean, you have this new powerful body, but you're clearly lacking experience and cool skills!
Too bad we didn't remember this in the lab, Mimmi could have just uploaded the knowledge straight into your brain...
Oh? Is that what you were trying to say?
Really?
Hah, well, you should have blinked harder!
Anyway, I think I can teach you a couple of useful tricks, and the rest...
Well, you're here for the long haul, so you'll figure it out eventually, just don't die too quickly...</div>


### Just a Rat

If a guard gets close and suspects something, just freeze in the shadows for a couple of minutes. They'll loudly say it's probably rats and quickly leave. Note, this only works if you're incredibly dangerous but never kill the guards, giving them a chance to pretend they didn't notice you!

![Just a Rat](images/R28C1.avif)

### Master of Disguise

Well... If you're not strong enough and not ready to fight your way through every time you're in a city, you should learn to hide and disguise yourself. Regular costumes, wigs, a bit of illusion, and you'll be able to fool ordinary people without much trouble.

![Master of Disguise](images/R28C2.avif)

### Survival

Surviving in the wild? Do I look like a scoutmaster? You're a monster now, not some city dweller, so you don't need to struggle to live in wild conditions. Catching prey is easier than going to the store, and neither heat nor cold will bother you!

![Survival](images/R28C3.avif)

### Combos

In close combat, there's only one simple secret - combo chain! Learn a few and just keep hitting without giving your opponent a chance to recover or strike back! Your stamina, speed, and strength should be enough to defeat any knight one-on-one!

![Combos](images/R28C4.avif)

### Dodging

No, no, why do you need defense, blocks, and all that stuff? Personally, I prefer to just run away... Alright, alright, I'll teach you to anticipate attacks and dodge before you get hit. But seriously, it's much easier to do this while running away!

![Dodging](images/R28C5.avif)

### Silence

A universal solution for foolish mortal mages who use spells with verbal components! Just one flick of your tail, and they can't say anything for half an hour! This also works as a gag if some girl screams too loudly and calls the guards!

![Silence](images/R28C6.avif)

### Demonic Runes

Honestly, I never learned all the hellish runes... But you know, demons usually don't bother with such details. Just write what you want and pour in a lot of energy! If you're strong enough, no one will dare disobey you!

![Demonic Runes](images/R28C7.avif)

### Brand of Sacrifice

Oh, I remember! The Brand of Sacrifice! It smells incredibly delicious to bloodthirsty demons! Any mortal with this seal on their body is fair game for anyone! They will be attacked relentlessly until they are eaten, and someone might even come for dinner from another world!

![Brand of Sacrifice](images/R28C8.avif)

### Succubus Seal

Honestly, I have no idea why you would brand someone you've already caught... But this succubus seal will grant any girl a super weak copy of my powers! But the main thing - you will become her master! You can control her lust, order her to do silly things, and so on.

![Succubus Seal](images/R28C9.avif)

### Exclusive Rights

If you don't want anyone else to touch your favorite heroines - mark them on the butt. Oh, I'm saying - the form doesn't matter, just pour in a lot of power! I think soon many will even pay for this when they get tired of being raped by hundreds of ordinary monsters...

![Exclusive Rights](images/R28C10.avif)

### Spiritual Weapon

Soul weapons used to be quite popular, I don't know why they aren't used anymore... You can summon them at any moment, and they deal very high damage because they are tens of times stronger than steel and can even block magic...

![Spiritual Weapon](images/R28C11.avif)

### Astral Shell

Actually, if you try really hard, you can even make soul armor! It's like having your own little mech! Oh! I remember... Yes, if spiritual weapons get damaged, you actually lose part of your soul and memories... But hey, they are very strong!

![Astral Shell](images/R28C12.avif)

### Astral Blast

Yeah, demons constantly rip souls out of people, it's a common thing... but If you suck out just a little bit, it even regenerates! Well... or you can just cause a spiritual explosion that throws the souls of mortals away and they all die... So brutal and wasteful... It's like throwing away food!

![Astral Blast](images/R28C13.avif)

### Plug It

Clever heroines will quickly figure out that they need to wear crystal buttplugs to keep their souls in place and will wear them before every battle! What? How will they figure this out? Well... I can tell them myself? Hey, it's so much more fun that way!

![Plug It](images/R28C14.avif)

### Stealthy Advances

As long as you at least try to hide your grouping and there's a chance that those around won't notice, girls will stubbornly pretend that nothing is happening, and that everything is fine. Even if you're literally fucking them in the ass!

![Stealthy Advances](images/R28C15.avif)

### Common Sense

All these auras of normality don't work well on monsters, but even your victims will perceive it as something natural. Monsters are supposed to rape beauties - it's just right! So if you forget this - they will remind you themselves! And they will insist on it!

![Common Sense](images/R28C16.avif)

### Bliss

Right after sex, your praise and headpat are felt by the victims as something so pleasant that they will immediately forgive you for anything and try to earn more praise, feeling like good girls again. Note, the effect lasts only half an hour!

![Bliss](images/R28C17.avif)

### Big Fan

If you're really interested in what your favorite adventurer is up to - you can just follow her around in a mask. Everyone will understand that you're an evil demon or something, but... As long as you act like a fan and just watch, no one will care!

![Big Fan](images/R28C18.avif)

### Luck Thief

After each victory, you'll steal a portion of the heroes' luck. So don't be surprised if a heroine who challenges you for the tenth time trips and falls so awkwardly that she ends up with your cock in her throat!

![Luck Thief](images/R28C19.avif)

### Living Statue

You can do many amusing things with annoying heroines! For example, temporarily turn them into living statues! Oh no, it's not dangerous at all, they won't die and will still feel everything if, for instance, you leave their butt soft!

![Living Statue](images/R28C20.avif)

### Amputee

Or simply remove their extra limbs so they struggle less! Don't worry, they're just hidden, not cut off! I mean, if you cut them off, the heroines will just drink a healing potion or something! Ugh... Why did I even think of that?

![Amputee](images/R28C21.avif)

### Onaholes

Yeah, I've read that doujinshi too... And you know what? Turning heroines into soft silicone onaholes is a great idea! The spell lasts for several months, so you can even sell them in a sex shop when you get bored with them, haha!

![Onaholes](images/R28C22.avif)

### Size Change

Love more compact dolls? You can try shrinking girls, but honestly, without the elasticity of fairies, there's not much use for such tiny things. Unless you want to carry a couple of slaves in your pocket to undo it later and fuck them before bed!

![Size Change](images/R28C23.avif)

### Modify

Wait, you must have a couple of tentacles, right? Mimmi tries to attach them to everyone... Actually, with their help, it's very easy to gradually change people's bodies. You know, make their breasts bigger, their butt wider. Don't even ask me how I know...

![Modify](images/R28C24.avif)

### Power Sharing

You can share part of your power with any mortal, turning them into a similar but much weaker monster. Keep in mind that this energy won't return! It's like spending game experience on a spell, you'll have to recover for a month!

![Power Sharing](images/R28C25.avif)

### Magical Chains

Very simple and convenient magical chains - they have thousands of uses! You can bind enemies in battle, set traps that automatically bind careless heroines, even hold suspension bridges or something like that!

![Magical Chains](images/R28C26.avif)

### Spirit Binding

If you add even more energy, you can even bind and control a spirit! Genies love these games, so if you're a good Master, you'll regularly find their lamps in your room! But it's not so easy with the others.

![Spirit Binding](images/R28C27.avif)

### Clairvoyance

Distant vision will be useful not only to know the enemy's plans in advance but also to peep at beauties in the shower! Just don't forget to hide well or set guards around your body so that someone doesn't stab you while your spirit is traveling the world.

![Clairvoyance](images/R28C28.avif)

### Astral Touch

That's right! You're learning fast, Anon! If you put in more energy, you can not only peep but also, for example, pinch a bathing beauty's butt! And if you really, really try, you can even fuck her!

![Astral Touch](images/R28C29.avif)

### Vimpere Gaze

If you look someone in the eye for 2 minutes, you can easily charm them and for the next 3 hours they'll think you're a real stunner! This will even change their memories, as if you always looked like that!

![Vimpere Gaze](images/R28C30.avif)

### Thralls

Charm them again and again, fuck them in ways no one else ever could, show them how pleasant it is to be your slave - and they'll want to share this happiness with their girlfriends! They might even kidnap them, believing it's for their own good!

![Thralls](images/R28C31.avif)

### Hypnosis

Actually, it's very easy to hypnotize people if you gain their trust for at least an hour or two. I mean, you probably won't be able to do this in battle, but with charmed girls, there usually aren't any problems...

![Hypnosis](images/R28C32.avif)

### Deep Sleep

Just one touch and a sleeping girl will fall into an even deeper sleep and won't wake up no matter what you do to her! No, no, this is definitely not a succubus power! We don't fuck sleeping people! I... I just peeked at this spell... Yeah!

![Deep Sleep](images/R28C33.avif)

### Portal Mastery

In my opinion, portals are the best school of magic! Why even fight enemies and throw combat spells when you can escape? Or toss an annoying enemy into a neighboring kingdom!

![Portal Mastery](images/R28C34.avif)

### Way Stones

You can create stationary portal stones. They're hard to carry around or hide, so soon everyone will be using them. Merchants will even be willing to pay for you to add a couple of stones closer to the capital!

![Way Stones](images/R28C35.avif)

### Portal Fuck

Just place your mark on a heroine and you can create a tiny portal right between her legs at any time to fuck her wherever she is, wherever she hides! Of course, you'll have to defeat her and place the mark first...

![Portal Fuck](images/R28C36.avif)

### Cursed Panties

But you can cheat and create cursed panties with a built-in portal! If they give great stats that only increase over time, greedy adventurers will endure your cock with all their might so as not to lose their accumulated bonus!

![Cursed Panties](images/R28C37.avif)

### Glory Holes

And to keep them from getting too strong - you can sell toys with portal access! The bigger the bonus a heroine has, the cheaper the access to her holes! Ha, in a few months, she'll be fucked non-stop! How long do you think they'll last?

![Glory Holes](images/R28C38.avif)

### Necromancy

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">...accept our dark gift and the dead shall serve your will... ...cause your enemies to suffer forever... ...force them to turn against their former allies... to murder their own family... ...fill the lands with rotting corpses and the stench of the grave... </div>

![Necromancy](images/R28C39.avif)

### Raid Boss

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">...pathetic mortals... ...feed on their souls, give form to their nightmares... ...the more wretches you ensnare, the greater your power... ...hundreds, thousands... ...it matters not... ...their blood will only fuel you as you march over their shattered remains... </div>

![Raid Boss](images/R28C40.avif)

### Bonfire Save

Hey? Are you falling asleep already? I was just about to tell you about...<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">...bones... ...fire... ...ash and blade... ...a small sacrifice... ...while souls burn... ...you shall return to this day... ...this hour... ...as if nothing happened... ...fight again... ...and again... </div>

![Bonfire Save](images/R28C41.avif)

### Eternal

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">...not even death will stop you... ...you will rise again... and again... ...from the ashes of others' souls... ...even after thousands of years... ...you will become part of the world... ...none can destroy you forever... ...we are eternal... ...we know how to wait... </div>

![Eternal](images/R28C42.avif)

## New Breeds

<div style="color: #9e2323;">Ugh, Anon, that was rude!
You fell asleep right in the middle of your training!
Yeah, yeah, I know I'm a shitty teacher...
Because I usually don't prepare monsters for world domination,
I just suck dicks, you know!
By the way, you've got a pretty nice morning wood~
So hard, so big...
Looks like it's about to explode!
So let me show my talents and fix that real quick~
Mmm~

Anyway!
As I said, you'll learn the rest on your own eventually.
The world is already changing because of your presence.
The ancient streams of magic are moving again, 
and it seems like Mimmi wasn't kidding about adding new versions of the T-Virus and other mutagens... </div>


### Evolution

Just look at these new animal species! Winged lions! And I bet they'll soon develop venomous tail spikes or something like that! Wait, what? Are they already wearing jewelry?! How did they even make them, I mean, they've still had paws?

![Evolution](images/R29C1.avif)

### Magical Beasts

What... What is this, huh? I can't even say what it was before! These magical creatures are so full of mana they literally glow in the dark! They'll probably learn to shoot lightning any day now! Man, I wish I'd brought my pokeballs on this trip...

![Magical Beasts](images/R29C2.avif)

### Legendary Monsters

Ah perfect, legendary monsters! I told you we should've claimed all the mana sources before someone else did! Too late now! Fortunately, there are usually only a few of these per continent, and they stay out of conflicts, remaining neutral since they're practically invincible!

![Legendary Monsters](images/R29C3.avif)

### Vimpires

Just look at what some humans have become! Barely a couple years have passed and they're already drinking blood like real vampires! Wonder if they'll transform into bats in this world too - what do you think? Maybe it's not too late to intervene and make them turn into squirrels instead?

![Vimpires](images/R29C4.avif)

### Kitsune

Oh, a kitsune! Damn it, she ran away... Why'd you have to scare her? Oh right, you're a terrifying monster... I miss their soft, fluffy tails so much... you wouldn't believe how fun they are to play with! What? No, even if I create an illusion, it wouldn't be half as fluffy as a real fox tail…

![Kitsune](images/R29C5.avif)

### Fungus

Wait, mushrooms? How the hell they evolve so much that we now have fungal zombies wandering around? Hold up, these people don't even know what fungicides are. Or that they need masks against fungal spores? Damn, we need to warn them immediately!

![Fungus](images/R29C6.avif)

### Succubi

Umm... Uhh... Yes? Succubi? Oh no, what are you talking about, I would never... Damn, stupid bitches! I told them to hide! Umm... Sorry... But my little sisters wrote me such pitiful letters! Hell still doesn't have enough sinners, and it's so easy to hunt here!

![Succubi](images/R29C7.avif)

### Ancient Horror

No-no-no! Don't even look at me! How could I possibly summon such a monster? Just look at it - it's thousands of years old, that's why it's so huge! It probably just slept somewhere at the ocean bottom until the activated mana flows woke it up.

![Ancient Horror](images/R29C8.avif)

### Orcs

No, these aren't demons. I'm telling you! This has nothing to do with me! Who cares if they're red - these are orcs! Just your typical orcish horde; I have no idea where they keep coming from, they're like rats! Turn your back for one second and suddenly their war drums are echoing across the steppes!

![Orcs](images/R29C9.avif)

### Bigger Insect

Well, I think it's just natural that insects grew larger and started using girls too... I mean, isn't it more convenient than just laying eggs in some puddle? The womb is a perfect, warm, and moist incubator, they're practically made for this! Huh, well, at least they don't bite like mosquitoes!

![Bigger Insect](images/R29C10.avif)

### Nature's Warriors

Strange, I thought nature was perfectly fine in this world, no toxic waste, harmful emissions, or anything like that... So why did these golems appear? What are they even trying to avenge? Or maybe they're protecting something instead?

![Nature's Warriors](images/R29C11.avif)

### Mascots

Aww, look how cute! Seems the world is already responding to your presence! You haven't even started conquering anything, and mascots are already running around looking for naive magical girls! Soon these silly will come running to you themselves, wanting to protect everyone!

![Mascots](images/R29C12.avif)

### Necrons

Ugh! Necrons! We need to call the dragons to burn everything here! Oh, damn, this isn't that CYOA... But where did they even come from? Mimmi said no one in this world practices necromancy, the Dark Gods haven't reached here yet? Damn, did we miss something?

![Necrons](images/R29C13.avif)

### Tycoons

Oh, no! This world is doomed! Just look at these ugly, greedy creatures! Those flabby cheeks, that haughty look of a pathetic impotent! They're disgusting! Any mad king or even tyrant is way better and more fun than these money grubbers!

![Tycoons](images/R29C14.avif)

### Portal Mold

What the hell is this stuff growing on the way stones? Some kind of mold? Last time I saw something like this was in Guy's fridge, and we had to burn the whole thing... Hey, why do I feel like it's watching me? We need to invent a flamethrower ASAP.

![Portal Mold](images/R29C15.avif)

## Adaptation

<div style="color: #9e2323;">Wow, this world is changing so fast!
To be honest, I was just planning to hang out with you for a while until I got bored, but there's so much fun stuff happening!
Ha, just look at those heroines adapting to the new monsters and getting ready to fight for their world!
I bet Mimmi never expected everything to be so fast and so cool!
And all these hentai...
Oh! Uh... Wait, is this all happening because I came along with you?
One tiny succubus couldn't possibly change an entire world, right?
Well, maybe I sucked a couple... thousand dicks...
Showed them a few new positions... deepthroat techniques...
Taught the local girls how to enjoy anal...
Massive cocks...
Well... Maybe I had to show them a few helpful potions...
But damn it!
There's no way I could've changed everything THIS much!
Right! You're a pervert too! A whole hentai monster!
This must be your influence!
Wait... But wasn't this the plan all along... then why...
Ahhh!!! Screw it, I'm totally confused now!
Whatever, let's just have fun!
<small><small>and I'll just tell Mimmi that you're the one who corrupted everything...</small></small></div>

### Population Shift

Oops! The brave heroes were supposed to prepare for the invasion of the dark gods or something... But these weaklings are dying like flies! Huh, I guess war isn't good for men's health, so now there are 8 girls per guy!

![Population Shift](images/R30C1.avif)

### Easy Prey

Many girls in this world are so delicate that they're even afraid of mice and can't resist at all! Even the weakest goblin can easily defeat them!

![Easy Prey](images/R30C2.avif)

### Submission Lessons

Well... At least no one is killing the girls, so they quickly learned the correct position for copulation. Or capitulation? Oh, I think for them, it's the same thing now!

![Submission Lessons](images/R30C3.avif)

### Brave Heroines

Hey! At least some girls are brave, determined, and persistent enough to become heroines! Even if they lose again and again, they're definitely gaining experience in... battles!

![Brave Heroines](images/R30C4.avif)

### Distracting Tactics

The heroines quickly figured out the main weakness of perverted monsters like you, so they always wear the most provocative armor, trying to distract and arouse the enemy. Fighting with a hard-on is really inconvenient!

![Distracting Tactics](images/R30C5.avif)

### Hentai Defence

Wow, they've already invented the main hentai enchantment for armor! Well, armor bras are a bit useless without it... So now clothing and armor absorb all damage from attacks, tearing apart, but it doesn't leave a trace on the skin

![Hentai Defence](images/R30C6.avif)

### Strategic Surrender

Ha, very "brave"... It seems they never fight to the end, and when they're left with just a few pieces of clothing, the heroines drop their weapons and surrender, willingly taking dick after dick. But because they saved some strength, they almost always escape captivity the next day.

![Strategic Surrender](images/R30C7.avif)

### Sissy Survival

Ha, some guys are also trying to learn how to survive in the new world! It seems they even grow long hair and use skin cream to look as feminine as possible. Ha, they even wear skirts and wiggle their butts like real bitches!

![Sissy Survival](images/R30C8.avif)

### Sharing

Because there are now many more girls than boys... oh no, these weaklings couldn't invent harems. Instead, guys are used as sex toys, and sharing your guy with a couple of friends is considered completely normal!

![Sharing](images/R30C9.avif)

### Yandere Rising

See! I always said you shouldn't give too much power and freedom to bitches! You just need to fuck them more often! I mean, look at how many yandere there are now! They're everywhere! No one is even surprised when they break into someone's house!

![Yandere Rising](images/R30C10.avif)

### Futanari Boom

So fast! Just recently there were only a few of them in the whole world, and now futanari make up almost one-twentieth of the population! And their numbers are growing! Did you accidentally infect them with the futa virus?

![Futanari Boom](images/R30C11.avif)

### Futa Kingdom

Ugh... of course... their own kingdom where they dominate everyone and fuck every hole... They're always so horny~ I definitely need to spend a couple of weeks here to study everything properly!

![Futa Kingdom](images/R30C12.avif)

### Beauty Standards

Oh, now all the girls are at least an 8 out of 10. Heroines are usually even more beautiful! What? Where are the rest? Mmm... Wait, didn't they teach you in school how evolution works? Those who didn't adapt were eaten!

![Beauty Standards](images/R30C13.avif)

### Combat Make-Up

The girls are really trying to adapt! They have to look perfect to win; and even more so - to lose! So they're even willing to abandon their companions in battle to quickly fix their makeup, because that's the most important thing!

![Combat Make-Up](images/R30C14.avif)

### Hard Training

Heroines take their combat training very seriously! One hour of sword fighting, two hours of running, and three hours tied to a sex machine! They may not always win, but they run fast and take whatever the monsters do to them!

![Hard Training](images/R30C15.avif)

### Nymphos

Heroines need to keep themselves in the best shape, so they often, for fun, pounce on a random guy and fuck him unconscious with particular brutality!

![Nymphos](images/R30C16.avif)

### Skilled

Ha... Wait, they don't even take weapons with them anymore, they just start sucking the monsters off right away... Are they so confident in their abilities? Hey, wait, can they really fuck to win half a dozen orcs alone?!

![Skilled](images/R30C17.avif)

### Cheese

Captives always willingly pose for any humiliating photos. They're even ready to hold the pose for several hours while an artist paints a picture, because if you send this to her relatives and friends - she'll be rescued sooner!

![Cheese](images/R30C18.avif)

### Guilds

Some taverns quickly turned into real adventurer guilds. I mean, these rogues and heroes were hanging around here anyway, all they needed was a job board and some orders!

![Guilds](images/R30C19.avif)

### Lone Wolves

I thought witchers were long gone... But somehow they found refuge in this world, and now there are truly dangerous monster slayers wandering about. Fortunately, they usually work alone.

![Lone Wolves](images/R30C20.avif)

### Classic Party

The classic 4-5 adventurer group. Tank, DPS, support... well, you know how it usually goes. Probably really is the perfect balance of risk, fun and profit.

![Classic Party](images/R30C21.avif)

### Big Groups

Seems like in this world they love large companies! At least a dozen adventurers go on each quest. That way they can always cover each other and never get bored!

![Big Groups](images/R30C22.avif)

### Raid

They must be cowards, because these "heroes" prefer to hunt in groups of 50-70! That's a whole army platoon! You should see 50 rookies chasing one goblin!

![Raid](images/R30C23.avif)

### Professional Army

Wait... aren't they supposed to... I mean this is fantasy! Why did they organize a professional army? And they're fighting each other! Damn, looks like you'll need to fortify your lair very, very seriously!

![Professional Army](images/R30C24.avif)

### Healers

Some discovered a magical gift for healing, so they can easily cure any wounds in seconds. Healers are so respected that even monsters use them as intended. I mean not as intended... Argh! You get it!

![Healers](images/R30C25.avif)

### Healing Lick

Turns out every beauty's saliva in this world has healing properties, so after battle you can often see heroines licking each other like cats. Naked, of course - how else would you do it?

![Healing Lick](images/R30C26.avif)

### Tamers

A skilled mistress can subjugate anyone with a simple whip, strict discipline, and some sweet rewards. So it's no surprise they managed to tame some monsters...

![Tamers](images/R30C27.avif)

### Full Control

Wait... How does she even do that? Why does this zergling obey her when she's literally impaled on its dick?! Usually that means the monster won, right? Is she really that good??

![Full Control](images/R30C28.avif)

### Brawlers

What? Oh, nevermind, some monsters just love fighting and drinking too much. Nobody even tamed them, they just don't care who they fight with, and the guilds has excellent beer...

![Brawlers](images/R30C29.avif)

### Supports

This... This isn't fair! Even I took fifty years to learn this trick! How did they?... Oh, whatever... just remember that these sluts can boost their companions almost twofold! Strength, speed, all that stuff...

![Supports](images/R30C30.avif)

### Herbalist

After your arrival shook this world, not only monsters appeared but also various magical herbs, so now witches are experimenting like crazy! Well yeah, I gave them a couple of recipes myself and those hats, to keep things from getting confusing...

![Herbalist](images/R30C31.avif)

### Healing Potions

For example, the healing potion. Seriously, I think these weaklings wouldn't have survived without it! Think about it - how can you be an adventurer if a small wound takes months to heal and scars stay forever?

![Healing Potions](images/R30C32.avif)

### Aphrodisiac

Or the love potion~ Haha, I didn't think I'd make this aphrodisiac so popular! They even throw it like gas grenades to make everyone around get super horny and drop their weapons to start fucking!

![Aphrodisiac](images/R30C33.avif)

### Live Baits

Live bait is a standard and very effective practice! Though in this case, they have to use one of the heroines, leaving her well-tied and defenseless... And usually she has to endure until all the monsters gather!

![Live Baits](images/R30C34.avif)

### Banners

Oh, you've seen those living banners too? Damn beautiful! Sorry, I haven't quite figured out what they're for yet. Maybe they're trying to distract or taunt the enemy with the sight of a beautiful pussy? Or inspire allies?

![Banners](images/R30C35.avif)

### Fuck Meats

Adventurers are damn cunning and often prefer not to fight in dungeons, but to leave specially hired whores here and there to distract the monsters. They tie them up really well, so it's hard to take them captive - you have to fuck them on the spot!

![Fuck Meats](images/R30C36.avif)

### Breeding Brands

The best fuck meats even get tattoos with symbols of their preferred monsters that they handle best. Well... other sluts often do the same, since monsters respect this choice and sometimes swap captives.

![Breeding Brands](images/R30C37.avif)

### Unhindered

The magical core is located in the chest, and any clothing usually interferes with magic. So all sorceresses proudly walk around with bare tits, thinking it increases damage by whole 5%! Huh? No, actually much less, but the important thing is they believed me!

![Unhindered](images/R30C38.avif)

### Succubus Style

Sorry-sorry, I got carried away and showed them some effective combat techniques from the succubus arsenal... But now they all believe that the most powerful attacks must start from that position - with a naked pussy facing the enemy, haha!

![Succubus Style](images/R30C39.avif)

### Lesser Monsters

Actually, they're just wolves... But the heroines are so used to fucking everything that now they call them "lesser monsters" and deal with them in the usual way. Well... When they're too bored on the journey and there are no real monsters around...

![Lesser Monsters](images/R30C40.avif)

### Paladin's Mount

A true paladin's horse isn't just a mount! It's a real battle companion, friend, lover! They believe the stronger it bonds with its owner, the more fiercely it will help them! So all knights take really good care of them at night!

![Paladin's Mount](images/R30C41.avif)

### Summoner Secrets

Hmm, amazing new traditions! Looks like summoners really love inviting their girlfriends to share mastery secrets... though it's weird why they call them "another set of holes for Master"... Ah, whatever!

![Summoner Secrets](images/R30C42.avif)

### Natural Artifacts

The very nature of this world tries to help heroes fight darkness and chaos. You know, like sword in stone, sword in lake... Seems here artifacts sometimes literally grow on trees...

![Natural Artifacts](images/R30C43.avif)

### Cursed Items

By the way, you said you can't make cursed items... Time to urgently fix that! we need to spread them as soon as possible! Just don't make them too dangerous or deadly - then no one would wear them at all! 

![Cursed Items](images/R30C44.avif)

### Full Sets

And most importantly - even the most lewd artifacts need useful properties! I prefer making full-sets that help everyone around, then party members will make the heroines wear them themselves!

![Full Sets](images/R30C45.avif)

### Living Suits

Did you scatter living suits as a prank? Hmm... Strange, did they find them in ancient ruins? Or were they kept in treasuries for desperate times? Either way, looks like heroines now are ready even for this now!

![Living Suits](images/R30C46.avif)

### Symbiotic Bond

A good symbiotic costume can't just be taken off or put on! It's a long and complex procedure, at least several hours, during which a couple more symbiotes will help the newbie rape the heroine until her body gives in!

![Symbiotic Bond](images/R30C47.avif)

### Protective

I thought they were just funny sex toys, but actually these suits are incredibly strong and durable! Fortunately they usually just try to prevent harm to the heroine, rather than truly helping in battle.

![Protective](images/R30C48.avif)

### Common Prostitution

Prostitution and sex industry in this world are incredibly developed and I can rightfully be proud of that~ I mean, where did you think I get money for our adventure, huh?

![Common Prostitution](images/R30C49.avif)

### Payment Makes Right

Oops, seems locals understood everything a bit wrong... Doesn't matter if the girl wanted it or not, if she was paid generously, everyone around will think everything's perfectly fine!

![Payment Makes Right](images/R30C50.avif)

### School Bullies

It's believed that a bit of violence will only temper future heroine's spirit and prepare her for harsh reality, so no one punished school bullies, and they're doing whatever they want!

![School Bullies](images/R30C51.avif)

### Corrupted Nobles

Secret lodges, debauched parties, group rapes at the evening balls, conspiracies, perversions, betrayals~ The aristocrats have become so corrupted! It's so much fun with them! Oh, I mean spying on them!

![Corrupted Nobles](images/R30C52.avif)

### Deal with the Devil

I was just sucking off one noble when he somehow dispelled the illusion... But he just grabbed me by the horns and, continuing to fuck me, said he's ready to make a deal with you. Help him overthrow his royal father and he'll help you catch the most famous heroines.

![Deal with the Devil](images/R30C53.avif)

### Crime Spree

Whew, cities are crawling with clever thieves and dangerous bandits! Seems there are whole criminal guilds here! Even I got almost robbed by a dozen tasty thugs yesterday~

![Crime Spree](images/R30C54.avif)

### Harsh Laws

The laws of all kingdoms have become much harsher and even cruel. Huge fines that bankrupt entire clans, torture, filthy overcrowded prisons, even executions!

![Harsh Laws](images/R30C55.avif)

### Public use

Phew... Luckily girls are rarely executed though, and heroines are usually punished with a simple public gangbangs. Just a day on the square, and she's already free, crawling back to the tavern dripping with semen!

![Public use](images/R30C56.avif)

### Beg for It

To make sure these bitches don't think they can get away with anything, they're tied in very uncomfortable poses. After half an hour their legs get tired and they have to scream and beg for someone to support their heavy ass while fuck them!

![Beg for It](images/R30C57.avif)

### Slavery

After a dozen harsh punishments in a row, a girl is declared hopeless and sold into slavery. Though by that point they're usually happy about it, already anticipating fun life in brothel or harem!

![Slavery](images/R30C58.avif)

### Transformed

Looks like they use cursed items that temporarily change the body... Are they embarrassed to fuck heroines? Or is it more convenient to punish guys? Hah, damn, seems they just developed a kink for monster-girls!

![Transformed](images/R30C59.avif)

### Sacrifices

Legendary beasts and other monsters are too dangerous, so many settlements prefer to pay them off by sacrificing their best beauties... After a few weeks, however, they usually return with completely destroyed holes.

![Sacrifices](images/R30C60.avif)

### Naval Progress

Trade became incredibly important for survival, so people started building many more ships. Whole fleets now cross the seas, and their cannons can repel any monsters!

![Naval Progress](images/R30C61.avif)

### Industrial Revolution

Looks like Mimmi was right - conflict drives progress! Just a bit of wild magic, and people are already building factories and steam engines! How did they invent everything so quickly?

![Industrial Revolution](images/R30C62.avif)

### Mechanical Dolls

This is strange... Steam engines and cannons are one thing, but... Mechanical dolls?! They're almost robots! It's impossible to invent this in just a few years! Were they hiding ancient knowledge?

![Mechanical Dolls](images/R30C63.avif)

### Social Change

Not all aristocrats adapted to new times, so workers and peasants quickly took matters into their strong hands... Protests, uprisings, burning castles, revolutionary parties...

![Social Change](images/R30C64.avif)

### Public Welfare

People became too valuable to neglect, so now there's plenty of free food, hospitals... even education! Seems they really needed a crisis to teach everyone to read!

![Public Welfare](images/R30C65.avif)

### Faith Crisis

People gradually lost faith in their idle gods. Temples stand empty and even nuns barely pay attention to old prohibitions. I almost feel sorry for them, maybe I should visit?

![Faith Crisis](images/R30C66.avif)

### Defenders

Hey! I thought they were desperate, but after a small gathering they simply decided to take charge! Nuns rarely hunt monsters, but fiercely protect everyone around and even offer themselves in exchange for captured girls!

![Defenders](images/R30C67.avif)

### Strong Faith

Hard times only strengthened people's faith. They pray more desperately than ever and although gods remain silent, this faith helps them endure many trials and hardships, thinking it's all for a greater cause. Hmm... If Mimmi heard this...

![Strong Faith](images/R30C68.avif)

### Hot Rituals

The nuns rightly decided that the boring old prayers must have bored the gods, and that's why they don't listen... So they turned all the rituals into hot shows! It's impossible to look away from their striptease on the altar!

![Hot Rituals](images/R30C69.avif)

### Divine Protection

Haha! It seems they managed to attract the attention of the gods by shaking their asses! So now the gods often save heroines from bloodthirsty monsters, and I heard that a saintess whose life in the cathedral turned into a hentai show can perform real miracles!

![Divine Protection](images/R30C70.avif)

### Pagan Revival

Ancient pagan cults have been revived. Almost forgotten spirits are gaining strength and protecting their sacred groves. And, oh hell, you won't believe how fun their rituals are~ Even I had a hard time playing the role of the "sacrifice"!

![Pagan Revival](images/R30C71.avif)

### Superstitions

It is believed that this brings luck and attracts the attention of the gods, so before each battle, the most beautiful girl must dance an incredibly humiliating dance. Even if she is the leader of this squad!

![Superstitions](images/R30C72.avif)

### Game Mechanics

Oh! I completely forgot about these nanobots! Maybe I should have made a section with them a little earlier, but... Anyway, they will slightly change the world, making it similar to a game! At least the heroines will have stats, HP, statuses, and all that!

![Game Mechanics](images/R30C73.avif)

### Admin Access

The main thing is that you will have developer access and can slightly change their characteristics when they are nearby~ Increasing tits is a small thing, you can even remove clothes or make items cursed!

![Admin Access](images/R30C74.avif)

### System Quests

You can even create "system" quests with high penalties for failure! And if you are careful, no one will even suspect that it is your doing! Just have fun, ordering them to sell themselves or collect 1000 daisies!

![System Quests](images/R30C75.avif)

### Turn-Based

Now the entire combat system will be turn-based. Heroes, monsters, even traps and poisons - everyone will wait their turn to act! So if a monster uses "rape," the companions will only be able to watch and gasp until their turn comes!

![Turn-Based](images/R30C76.avif)

### Public Sex Stats

Each heroine will have an incredibly detailed statistic. Of course, everything here is in Japanese, but I think the locals will quickly figure out what's what... Here it is indicated how many times she was fucked, in which hole, and how much she liked it!

![Public Sex Stats](images/R30C77.avif)

### Combat Logs

You will have access not only to all the statistics but even to the combat logs! There are even video recordings here, so you will always have access to the freshest and hottest porn with your favorite heroine!

![Combat Logs](images/R30C78.avif)

## More Lewd <s>Adaptations</s> Curses

<div style="color: #9e2323;">Wow! This world has changed so much!
It's become a much more fun place, don't you think?
All these heroines, monsters, drunken brawls in taverns...
That's exactly what real fantasy should look like!
Alright, now let's move on to the lewd changes...
Hey, what do you mean there's already enough lewdness?
There's never enough lewdness! 
And you're a hentai monster, so you should be corrupting this world, 
so shut up and fuck everyone you catch, haha!
</div>


### Easy Aroused

Everyone gets excited very easily. It no longer depends on fear, love or situation. If a girl sees a cock, even a monster, she gets aroused! And when the excitement reaches a peak - she will not be able to hold back and give herself to sex!

![Easy Aroused](images/R31C1.avif)

### "Curses"

You can see the most indecent behavior on the streets now! Beautiful girls crawl on all fours, rub their asses against passersby, and even pee in public! Often it's a real curse, but I've definitely seen some who are just having fun pretending to be cursed!

!["Curses"](images/R31C2.avif)

### Monster Miasma

In monster lairs, it's easy to catch a dangerous disease that spreads like the flu among heroines. It causes a terrible itching in the throat and a desire to swallow a hot cock as soon as possible. And if she sucked 20 different dicks, the disease will instantly go away!

![Monster Miasma](images/R31C3.avif)

### Public Property

The curse situation has gotten damn serious, and society had to adapt! Now it's incredibly rude, almost criminal, to deny a girl a blowjob if she says she needs it because of a curse! I mean, she might really suffer if she doesn't feel a cock in her throat for too long!

![Public Property](images/R31C4.avif)

### Sensitive Nipples

From frequent stimulation, curses, or that special additive I sometimes put in the water, all the girls' breasts have grown much larger, and their nipples are as sensitive as a clit at peak arousal. Playing with them is so pleasurable that almost everyone loses them when they think, and a low-cut top will soon become the norm!

![Sensitive Nipples](images/R31C5.avif)

### Anything For Stats

Wait... Damn, it looks like they realized that unlike the rest of the cursed things, you can put two items in the dildo slot at once! Or three! Hell, some heroines put in a dozen cursed toys at once for the massive bonuses!

![Anything For Stats](images/R31C6.avif)

### One Hole Fits All

Hey! That's not fair! Seriously, when I made these curses, I didn't think they'd be shoving everything up their cunts! That's a fuck hole, not a place for three dozen cursed rings, five wands, and my lost pocket balls! Give them back, bitches!

![One Hole Fits All](images/R31C7.avif)

### Anal Addiction

Yeah, finally these dumbasses have learned to enjoy anal! I spent a ton of time on this and had to increase the sensitivity of all assholes by 500%, but now many heroines don't even use their pussies, preferring to take any dick in their ass!

![Anal Addiction](images/R31C8.avif)

### Virgin Seals

The most desperate girls even put on a special seal that completely blocks their pussy for a year, so even if monsters catch them, they remain virgins! Oh, yeah, even after months of non-stop gangbangs, they're still considered pure and innocent!

![Virgin Seals](images/R31C9.avif)

### Tail Trends

Hmm... There aren't many monster girls in the world yet, but tails have become incredibly popular... Wait, they're all wearing butt plugs with tails! And unexpectedly yanking a friend's tail is even considered good manners, especially if she cums from it!

![Tail Trends](images/R31C10.avif)

### Size Matters

After the monsters with their huge dicks, most of the girls quickly developed a real passion for really big pieces of meat! Huh, I guess the heroines really love to overcome challenges!

![Size Matters](images/R31C11.avif)

### Bored

No, seriously, they won't even consider anything smaller than their own hand! Even if a guy manages to seduce them, the heroines get bored in bed within a minute. After all, their tummies don't even bulge and their wombs are completely empty!

![Bored](images/R31C12.avif)

### Breeding Kink

Better than monster dicks can only be monster pregnancies! Almost all heroines succumb to this pleasure in their first captivity and then always secretly dream of repeating it, even running to the monsters themselves for that unique bliss, even if they have a lover.

![Breeding Kink](images/R31C13.avif)

### Hyper-Fertility

Oh, yeah, pregnancy. It seems all the sluts in this world have become hyper-fertile. Just a few loads of cum and she'll almost certainly get pregnant, regardless of her cycle! But monster pregnancies usually last only a week or two, and even normal ones now take just a couple of months!

![Hyper-Fertility](images/R31C14.avif)

### Frindly Fire

Oh... sorry... I was gone for almost a week, but I found out something very important! Monsters in this world don't differentiate between girls and monster-girls, and treat us exactly the same! I mean, they fuck us in every hole with all their might! Ah, it was so delicious!

![Frindly Fire](images/R31C15.avif)

### Purrfect Pals

Catgirls are probably the only exception. They're incredibly friendly with everyone - humans and monsters. They live in cities and wild tribes and often act as intermediaries in ransoming captives. Don't worry, when they go into heat, they hit on everyone!

![Purrfect Pals](images/R31C16.avif)

### Shortfuck

Little girls are too small for war with monsters, since they can't fit their dicks, so everyone recognized that their only purpose was to be quick stress relievers. So now any girl under five feet can be fucked by any man at any time.

![Shortfuck](images/R31C17.avif)

### Witchy Woes

Everyone knows how witches pay the spirits and monsters they summon, so they're treated just like the cheapest, dirtiest whores everywhere. But it seems they just take it as another contract and hardly pay attention to it...

![Witchy Woes](images/R31C18.avif)

### True Art

Everyone loves famous heroines and their legendary adventures, so many cities have erected monuments in their honor... And all of them try to capture their otherworldly beauty and most epic battles!

![True Art](images/R31C19.avif)

### Hiden Maso

Wait, isn't this implied by default in all these hentai worlds? Anyway, all the heroines quickly become secret masochists, cumming ten times harder if they're raped against their will... You'd choose that, right? Have pity on the bitches!

![Hiden Maso](images/R31C20.avif)

### Complete Satisfaction

After their first powerful orgasm, they won't be able to stop and will beg the monsters to keep raping them, impaling themselves on every cock and even fisting each other until they pass out from exhaustion and multiple orgasms.

![Complete Satisfaction](images/R31C21.avif)

### Unbreakable

What? Oh, no, don't worry, no matter how many times they lose, how much they cry, how many times they're raped, humiliated, and raped again, the heroines' will never truly break. As soon as their HP recovers, they're full of energy, joy, and enthusiasm again, as if nothing happened!

![Unbreakable](images/R31C22.avif)

### Hyper Emotional

Honestly, sometimes they're even too cheerful and enthusiastic... As if all this madness isn't enough for them! They're incredibly emotional, constantly coming up with silly ideas and pretending to be much stronger than they appear. They even wear regular dildos, pretending they're cursed!

![Hyper Emotional](images/R31C23.avif)

### Proud

Ugh... All the heroines have become incredibly proud idiots! None of them will ever attack a monster from behind! They won't just challenge you to a fight, but they'll make a whole spectacle out of it with a long speech about the power of light and friendship! Hah, the contrast will be even starker when you impale them on your cock!

![Proud](images/R31C24.avif)

### Stubborn

Hah, these bitches are just incredibly proud, I love them! Even when you've ripped off all their clothes, they have no strength left to resist, and you're already fucking their throat - they still won't call for help and will continue pretending they have everything under control!

![Stubborn](images/R31C25.avif)

### Impatient

The heroines know that they only need to pass out, and they will be ‘resurrected’ on Resurrection Stone. So when they are captured, they immediately start demanding to be fucked harder and faster! There's no time to waste, push three cocks at once! End her faster!

![Impatient](images/R31C26.avif)

### Leashed

You can easily recognize a truly experienced heroine by the leash. They know that sooner or later they'll lose again, and monsters have an awful habit of dragging girls by their hair! So it's easier to wear a leash with a comfortable collar in advance so the monster has something to pull on their new sex slave!

![Leashed](images/R31C27.avif)

### Real Princess

Oh... It seems that the real, most delicate and spoiled pure-blooded princesses are actually incredibly strong! As if some hidden power was sleeping in their blood! Be careful, because they can easily give you a hard time!

![Real Princess](images/R31C28.avif)

### Rape Revenge

Many of them, after winning, start raping the monsters themselves, convinced that this is the right way to punish them - by milking their balls dry! Hah, try it yourself - just give in! Keep in mind, they're actually quite good at it, so you might even start begging for mercy!

![Rape Revenge](images/R31C29.avif)

### Comforting

After all these victories and defeats, the heroines almost always seek comfort in each other's arms, convinced that only another heroine can truly understand them, and only the warmth of their breasts and pussies can truly comfort them... So even strangers often sleep together, enjoying each other.

![Comforting](images/R31C30.avif)

### Helping Hole

Girls share joys and sorrows together, so if the heroine sees that you're already screwing someone - she'll rush to help, to take half of your wrath! They may drop their panties without even starting the fight, so as not to piss you off or arouse you even more!

![Helping Hole](images/R31C31.avif)

### Satisfying the Beast

Knowing that the faster you cum, the less the girl you are raping will suffer, all the other slave girls, captive heroines, etc. will do their best to satisfy you without thinking of their honor - even a proud princess would kneel down and start licking!

![Satisfying the Beast](images/R31C32.avif)

### Helping Newbies

The true heroine is always happy to help simple girls, so when inexperienced fuck meat gets captured, she'll immediately do everything possible to break her as quickly as possible! She'll even hold the girl down herself while she's being fucked, so the girl accepts the new reality faster!

![Helping Newbies](images/R31C33.avif)

### Status Symbols

Captives and slaves quickly became status symbols of luxury, so it's rare to see an aristocrat walking around town without a personal bitch on a leash. Many even buy real heroines from monsters just to play with them themselves!

![Status Symbols](images/R31C34.avif)

### Royal Rivalry

Not wanting to seem even a little weaker than you, many kings have also started their own harems! And if you, a monster, have gathered girls for yourself... Then they'll gather monster girls! The best and most lustful ones, and they'll show them off to everyone!

![Royal Rivalry](images/R31C35.avif)

### Siesta

At noon, it's really hot here, so even the monsters stop fighting and release the girls. But everyone always returns honestly and gets back into the exact same position, even if it means spreading their legs in front of a crowd of orcs themselves! I mean, otherwise, they'd really have to fight in the heat, and that sucks!

![Siesta](images/R31C36.avif)

### Legendary Mount

There's a legend that if a heroine can make a monster cum a hundred times without cumming herself, the monster will become her loyal pet for life. No one has actually managed this yet, but many want a powerful mount and often challenge strong monsters! I mean, who wants to fuck goblins?

![Legendary Mount](images/R31C37.avif)

### Gentle Monsters

Many monsters are incredibly gentle and sensual. They often give defeated heroines flowers and gifts, build entire towers for them, and surround them with luxury and care. Many captives, after such treatment, even fight off the heroes who come to rescue them!

![Gentle Monsters](images/R31C38.avif)

### Best Conditions

The first heroines to surrender are always treated better; at the very least, the monsters will thoroughly lick their holes before raping them, so sometimes heroines drop their weapons as soon as the battle starts, afraid that one of their friends might beat them to it!

![Best Conditions](images/R31C39.avif)

### Obedience or Death

Monsters do not let them forget for a moment that their lives are in the monsters' clutches, so the heroines always try to be especially obedient so that they do not get their hands or heads bitten off.

![Obedience or Death](images/R31C40.avif)

##  Dark Castle

<div style="color: #9e2323;">What? Oh, right!
Oh, I could spend ages exploring new worlds and visiting every tavern! 
But you're right!
A true Dark Lord needs their fortress!
The great castle of darkness and depravity!
So...
Maybe you can find a suitable spot while I...
Oh, alright... 
Fine, let's go, I'll help you...</div>


### Great Eye

We absolutely need to build a watchtower! It's not just a symbol of all-powerful evil, but also a convenient way to keep an eye on things! And if only Sauron hadn't been ogling naked elf girls and actually tried to track down his enemies, he wouldn't have lost!

![Great Eye](images/R32C1.avif)

### Living Core

A gift from Mimmi! Don't worry, only a couple of hours passed in her world, so she hasn't forgotten us yet! It's a Living Core, like a super-computer that amplifies your magic and can use it on its own. Don't worry, it's very obedient!

![Living Core](images/R32C2.avif)

### Dark Core

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">...a convenient tool... accept... power...</div>Ugh, what's wrong with it? Mimmi described it differently... Are you sure we don't need to ask her for some kind of medicine? Oh, it's even stronger now? Well... if you say so...

![Dark Core](images/R32C3.avif)

### Portable Emitter

Hah, you've surprisingly quickly figured out how to control it! Good job, Anon, you'll conquer the world in no time, haha! What's this, by the way? A portable corruption emitter? Hmm, want to corrupt everything even more? Great!

![Portable Emitter](images/R32C4.avif)

### Toxic Swamps

I heard that one genius adds toxic swamps to every game... Actually, I much prefer "fighting" right in the tavern... But heroes probably need variety, and your castle needs extra protection, right?

![Toxic Swamps](images/R32C5.avif)

### Chaos Titan

Hey, maybe I'm not so good at all that clever stuff, but I also have something to offer! Like Chaos Titan! This model has way too many extra legs, so nobody plays with it anyway... Actually, there's a lot of trash in the Warp, the key is not to get caught...

![Chaos Titan](images/R32C6.avif)

### Endurance Test

A few symbians will be set up in front of the castle and a sign that says that only a heroine is worthy of battle who will last here for a couple of hours. And all of them will obediently test their endurance, believing that this is the only way to challenge the Dark Lord!

![Endurance Test](images/R32C7.avif)

### Bick Dick Club

Your castle is an elite location, so there will always be a couple of succubi at the entrance, letting in only heroes with big dicks. They will laugh and mock everyone else so much that even a veteran paladin will run away in tears.

![Bick Dick Club](images/R32C8.avif)

### Extra Weapons

All the guards will be additionally armed with especially powerful vibrators, so even the most experienced heroines will come like little bitches if they get caught by them!

![Extra Weapons](images/R32C9.avif)

### Curse of Competition

I add an extra, secret curse... so it becomes much more important for the heroines to compete with each other than to defeat you, and they will often even push their friends into traps!

![Curse of Competition](images/R32C10.avif)

### Hidden Treasures

I'll be hiding some really valuable loot in special holes in the walls... It's incredibly easy to get stuck here for a couple of hours~ but I think greedy heroines won't be able to resist!

![Hidden Treasures](images/R32C11.avif)

### Denial Trap

I had to work hard to make this mimic trap only hold the victim and feed them aphrodisiac! But this way, when you find the heroine after a few hours or days, she'll be begging you to tear up all her holes!

![Denial Trap](images/R32C12.avif)

### Mimic Magic

Actually, mimics are incredibly useful creatures if trained properly! You don't even need workshops, as you can always train a mimic to pretend to be a carriage or something similar. Just remember to feed them girls!

![Mimic Magic](images/R32C13.avif)

### Moster Next Door

Just don't attack the nearby cities, and soon people will get used to you and stop being afraid. You'll be able to walk around shops and pubs without disguising yourself, and even serenade the best girls!

![Moster Next Door](images/R32C14.avif)

### Broadcasting

You're the first person in the world to think of it, so you're the only one who'll listen! You can propagandize your dark empire, your evil lewd lifestyle, just play music or do interviews! Even your rivals will agree to a temporary truce for this, because it's their only chance!

![Broadcasting](images/R32C15.avif)

### Beer Holder

Many monsters in your lands will simply live their lives. Not every monster needs to be a warrior or a bandit, right? Some will be ordinary peasants, builders, tavernkeepers... I think that with time, even ordinary people will live here.

![Beer Holder](images/R32C16.avif)

### Dragon's Hoard

When you accumulate enough coins, some impudent young dragon will claim this pile of gold as its bed... An excellent free guardian! Don't worry, I've already prepared a secret passage...

![Dragon's Hoard](images/R32C17.avif)

### Education

Just because your subordinate monsters doesn't mean they have to be stupid! It would be much more convenient if they could at least read letters with your orders, so it's worth opening schools for all who want to learn. I'll teach them the art of sex myself!

![Education](images/R32C18.avif)

### Healthcare

Monsters are resilient, like... well, monsters. But a little care won't hurt, at least it's worth pulling out the stuck spear from their back or the remnants of chainmail from between their teeth!

![Healthcare](images/R32C19.avif)

### Discipline

Strict discipline will allow you to turn even a pack of dirty goblins into a formidable army! Ordinary adventurers won't even have a chance to resist, they'll be thrown into hunting nets and bolos in a minute!

![Discipline](images/R32C20.avif)

### Hierarchy

Some monster girls will simply be sluts, meat for fucking in monster armies, and they understand their role perfectly. Actually, heroes often use them too... But they also let them go, not considering them a threat!

![Hierarchy](images/R32C21.avif)

### Scavengers

According to the rules, after defeat, the heroine should lie still for half an hour... But here are plenty of small, weak monsters that take advantage of this, naively hoping to escape when the enraged heroine gets up!

![Scavengers](images/R32C22.avif)

### Orcish Armor

Orcs use girls as living armor during their raids. Of course, no one fights them, and heroines sometimes even surrender themselves, because an orc with a girl on his dick can't carry anything else or catch up someone!

![Orcish Armor](images/R32C23.avif)

### Harem

Every lord should have a harem, otherwise, what's the point of seizing power? You'll have the best girls, and the right of the first night, so all the beautiful virgins from the conquered lands will end up in your bed~

![Harem](images/R32C24.avif)

### Diplomatic Etiquette

During formal meetings, all heroines must at least kiss your dick... And if you grab them by the hair and fuck them hard in the throat, it just means that you have to make a small discount in the negotiations!

![Diplomatic Etiquette](images/R32C25.avif)

### Baron's Bargain

You'll have an agreement with all the surrounding baronies. You won't attack them, limiting yourself to rare monster raids, but in exchange, they'll have to send you their daughters every month... Just for one night!

![Baron's Bargain](images/R32C26.avif)

### Mums

Just one night for the peace of the whole province? No way, these noble bitches will have to try hard! Each year, each of them must give birth to a monster child for you!

![Mums](images/R32C27.avif)

### Kindergarten

Uh... It seems all the heroines who got pregnant from you started bringing their little monsters to your castle, demanding that you take care of them yourself! Ugh... It seems you have no choice, even if some of these kids aren't yours...

![Kindergarten](images/R32C28.avif)

### Private Clinic

By the way, we can open a private clinic, you know, for small mutations, custom curses... I think guys will pay any amount of money to get a monster cock to finally satisfy their girlfriend!

![Private Clinic](images/R32C29.avif)

### Free Potions

Heroes can't live without healing potions, so let's scatter them around here and there? I think it'll be damn funny if we add a random temporary side effect~ Hey, did you think potions in games just appear out of nowhere?

![Free Potions](images/R32C30.avif)

### Slave Market

We should open our own slave market as soon as possible to capture this niche! The best bitches from all over the world will be brought here, and if we guarantee safety, even aristocrats will come here to shop!

![Slave Market](images/R32C31.avif)

### Gladiators

Bloody spectacles are always incredibly popular and don't require special expenses. We just need to build a coliseum, start accepting bets, and honestly pay out winnings, and fighters and spectators will find themselves!

![Gladiators](images/R32C32.avif)

### Rape Arena

Just a brawl is boring, so let's offer freedom to any captured heroine who can win in the rape arena with monsters! And if they like it, they can come again for a generous prize and fame!

![Rape Arena](images/R32C33.avif)

### Elite Casino

In this casino for the depraved elite, any bets are accepted, as an experienced demon will help draw up an unbreakable contract~ But many girls prefer to pay off right on the spot, and their moans only decorate this place!

![Elite Casino](images/R32C34.avif)

### Pony Racing

Horse racing? I don't understand why it was popular in your previous world, maybe if a girl was under the horse... Anyway, we don't have horses, but we have many captured heroines! We just need to train them a bit, and they'll make excellent pony girls for racing!

![Pony Racing](images/R32C35.avif)

### Strip Club

Oh, classic! Striptease, drinking, lewd shows, and humiliation right on stage~ I love it! I'll even show them how to do it myself~ It's better to leave them all the tips, then the captives will try much harder!

![Strip Club](images/R32C36.avif)

### Prison

Damn, we completely forgot about the prison! And I'm wondering why the captives are walking around the whole castle... We need to build a separate prison for them, just don't forget to make a normal toilet and shower, we're not in a grimdark!

![Prison](images/R32C37.avif)

### Extra Services

Haha! You're right! I love you, Anon! We need to add extra services for the captives! A better room, meals from a restaurant, walks, TV, makeup, salary... And all in exchange for sex! We can even make a CYOA for them!

![Extra Services](images/R32C38.avif)

### Masochistic Difficulty

Of course, you can set the difficulty level for them yourself! For example, lock them up with a tentacle monster, so it'll use their holes all the time, 24/7! Or add even more aphrodisiac to their food!

![Masochistic Difficulty](images/R32C39.avif)

### Couples

Oh, don't be so cruel! Why separate the couples? Better chain them together and curse the guy so he can never cum, although it'll always seem like he needs just a few more thrusts!

![Couples](images/R32C40.avif)

### Visitors

Of course, their friends can visit! Just every visitor has to undress, so they don't bring any forbidden items, and take a free aphrodisiac or futa candy, so they'll definitely have a good time together!

![Visitors](images/R32C41.avif)

### Dungeon Escape

Hey, let's turn the prison into a real game dungeon! They can easily escape from cells, but there'll be 10 levels with a bunch of lustful monsters ahead! And if the escapee gets caught three times, they'll be returned to their cell!

![Dungeon Escape](images/R32C42.avif)

### Brothels

After all, keeping and entertaining the captives is quite expensive, so let them earn the money themselves in brothels. If they try hard enough, they might even be able to buy their own freedom!

![Brothels](images/R32C43.avif)

### Breeding Sow

Or she can give birth to a couple of monsters and be free! The best conditions, free drugs, nice sex, and other tasty things! I'll try to make sure the breeding slaves are happy as in heaven, because then they'll give birth to the best monsters! They'll beg to stay!

![Breeding Sow](images/R32C44.avif)

### Meat Wall

Okay, in the end, we need simple monsters too... And we need a lot of them! So it's worth fixing the captives in a living wall and using them to the fullest, continuously pouring sperm into all their holes at once, so they'll give birth even faster!

![Meat Wall](images/R32C45.avif)

### Onahole Option

If the prison gets overcrowded, just turn some of the bitches into onaholes for a year and sell them, haha! I'm sure they'll be terribly ashamed and will only talk about the boring year in prison, not about how they were used by a bunch of perverts!

![Onahole Option](images/R32C46.avif)

### Prison Bitches

It seems this prison has become an incredibly famous and popular place... Rich nymphomaniacs are even offering money to relax here for a week! Haha, I think we can find the best cocks for them, so they'll come back again and again!

![Prison Bitches](images/R32C47.avif)

### Parting Gifts

I'll make a special collection of unique, cursed items with special properties to give to each released heroine as a farewell gift. Hehe... I'm sure many will want to collect the whole set~

![Parting Gifts](images/R32C48.avif)

## Monster-Girls

<div style="color: #9e2323;">Whoa, looks like some monsters have already gotten busy making monster girls while we were having fun... 
Or did you manage to knock up a couple hundred beauties? 
Well... Then you're a good boy!
Alright, let's try to figure out what kind of daughters you're producing and how many tails they have...</div>


### Transformation

It seems you can transform any beauty into a monster girl! All you need is more of your cum! More! Even more! Keep pumping until her belly swells up! That's it, and now me!

![Transformation](images/R33C1.avif)

### Legacy

Your daughters will always inherit a few of your traits. Of course, they'll have their own unique features, but they might also get your regeneration or even a spell you've learned, and they'll be able to use it from birth!

![Legacy](images/R33C2.avif)

### Metamorphosis

Each monster girl will have multiple forms. Usually, it's something like a "sweet everyday" and "ferocious battle" form, but it could be something entirely different. Like "underwater", "elemental", or even "weapon" form!

![Metamorphosis](images/R33C3.avif)

### Futa Form

Or "futanari"! Hah, monster girls are damn good at corrupting the world, but I recommend taking this so they can breed even faster on their own! Then it'll be a full-fledged independent species!

![Futa Form](images/R33C4.avif)

### Super Duper Cute

Aww~ They... They're all so incredibly cute and kawaii! I just want to catch each one of them to hug them close and give them a big cuddle! Squeeze their butt, give them gentle pets and listen to their sweet happy purring~

![Super Duper Cute](images/R33C5.avif)

### Reincarnation

If you happen to die, you can reincarnate into one of your offspring. Over time, it body will even transform into your previous one, and everyone will think that the "Dark Lord" is just the final form of the monster girls.

![Reincarnation](images/R33C6.avif)

##  


<div style="color: #9e2323;">Hmm? 
Wait, you seriously thought we'd be making a list of all the tails, scales, and wing types? 
In the name of Hell, Anon, do I look like a naturalist who enjoys collecting butterflies?
Heh~ 
Besides, there are too many of these bitches! 
And while we're chasing after them and studying their tails, new ones will keep appearing! 
So let's just make a general list of monster girl types, without the details.
</div>


### Arachnids

Oh, arachnids! Their webs are so convenient! You won't believe how nice it is to lie wrapped up in their cocoon while they fill you with eggs like a living incubator! Ah, I could lie there for weeks~

![Arachnids](images/R34C1.avif)

### Lamias

Hm! I mean... um... Oh, look, lamias! Snake girls! Wait, they're hissing... Must be venomous, so let's get out of here! Besides, their mouths... They clearly love swallowing their paralyzed prey whole, and that's bad for my skin!

![Lamias](images/R34C2.avif)

### Moth Girls

Emm... Moth girl? No, wait, those should have fluffy fur on their chest... And wings on their back... but... This is definitely some kind of moth, right? Well, at least those wings don't block the view of her soft butt!

![Moth Girls](images/R34C3.avif)

### Pixies

Aaah! My tail! Damn fairies, stop pulling it! Run away!! Aaah!! Ugh... Sorry, after one adventure in a world where there were millions of these nasty fairies, I think I developed a phobia... They just won't get tired of teasing and bullying, so imagine how annoying it gets after a month!

![Pixies](images/R34C4.avif)

### Glowis

At night, monsters usually glow to attract their prey, so let's observe her from a distance... Hmm... Or does she just like rave parties? No, no, she's probably just pretending, and if someone gets closer, she'll grab them and... oh... looks like she'll just fuck them, not eat them...

![Glowis](images/R34C5.avif)

### Demonettes

Oh, hello, sluts! Hmm? Oh, yes, Anon, of course, I know them! I even hunted with the one with seven tentacles for a busty commissar! No? Ugh... Must have mistaken her - they all look so similar... Anyway, demonettes are true experts in corrupting worlds!

![Demonettes](images/R34C6.avif)

### Centauroids

Tsk, what inconvenient spines - it's completely uncomfortable to sit here... Even for me! By the way, Anon, do you know what the problem is with these forms? The mouth is too small! They have to constantly eat something to feed their huge body! Look, she's chewing a sandwich even now!

![Centauroids](images/R34C7.avif)

### Harpys

Kawaii~ No, seriously, this owl harpy is so cute, so soft! I have no idea how she hunts, but just look at how skillfully she lifts her butt! Hey, wait, let me pet her a bit more! Or maybe we should just take her with us, huh?

![Harpys](images/R34C8.avif)

### Nightmares

Hmm... Black-pink girl, bright tentacles that appear right under her skin... Strange... Yes, she has a good butt, but... Ugh... Honestly, I feel uneasy around her for some reason, although I usually like nightmares and tentacles...

![Nightmares](images/R34C9.avif)

### Random

Ugggh... No, seriously, this was a stupid idea... There are too many of them! It's fun, but even I can't classify them! Just random monster girls, probably each one unique! Let's just end this chapter, okay?

![Random](images/R34C10.avif)

## Sergeants

<div style="color: #9e2323;">Alright, I've been putting this off for a while, but I guess you should finally get an army and all that...
Sorry, I really don't like all this fighting, blood, and combat magic...
So many treats going to waste!
But... 
oh well... 
fine, let's do this!
Here are your sergeants to start with.
Well, I mean, they'll probably rise to become generals or something later... 
but for now, since you don't have countless legions of monsters yet, they'll have to command small bands or something like that.</div>


### Abelia De'Npari

A brilliant secretary and organizer who spent many years in the royal chancellery. She's obsessed with optimization, which led to constant clashes with her superiors. Abelia believes she can harness your power to change the world for the better, because only a dictatorship can introduce strict laws and decisively reform the economy, breaking outdated processes. She's a true genius, so just let her implement her bold projects, and your empire will quickly become incredibly wealthy and powerful. And that you'll fuck her from time to time... She's an experienced secretary and accepts it as part of the job!

![Abelia De'Npari](images/R35C1.avif)

### V

One of the oldest vampires, V lived in this world even before your arrival. Her tiny clan grew too accustomed to hiding and fleeing after losing a war thousands of years ago. Most of the time, they just slept in deep caves, waiting for the return of darkness. So, as soon as they sensed your invasion, they set out to pledge their loyalty to you, dreaming of once again feeling like part of a true dark empire, rather than cowardly, hungry fugitives. V is well-versed in ancient artifacts and will be fanatically devoted to you, but she still fears sunlight and paladins.

![V](images/R35C2.avif)

### Neccari

A remarkably successful specimen of monster girls! I think Mimmi would be delighted to meet her, since Nekkari can easily melt and alter any flesh... Although her victims usually don't survive or go mad when she transforms them into meat golems and monsters... But perhaps she's just inexperienced! On the other hand, she can easily change herself and absorb dozens of tons of flesh, transforming into a powerful titan or a nimble, flexible mass of muscles and claws that can slip into any crevice and catch any prey! She can single-handedly replace an army, but usually prefers the form of a pale girl with a pair of additional clawed appendages.

![Neccari](images/R35C3.avif)

### Scull

I found this skull in the ruins. Generally, there's not much of interest there - everything has long since turned to dust over the thousands of years... But not Scull! I mean, it contains several dozen excellent magical crystals, and a couple of them still had energy left! I think it's not exactly correct to call it intelligent... Rather, it's a useful tool that contains fragments of souls... probably? In any case, it used to be an assistant to a powerful wizard or something like that. A repository of mana and spells, a notebook, a servant, a whipping boy, a key, and all that. An excellent multitool! It's ready to serve you, but still keeps the secrets of its former master.

![Scull](images/R35C4.avif)

### Kessoris Lyna

It's not hard to guess from the name of their order - the Battle Sisters live for battles! And if some idiot from the Ministorum tries to lock them up to guard some useless peaceful planet... It'll be even easier to corrupt them~ I mean, she spent only a few years there and when I offered her to fight for the dark lord, Lyna agreed without even asking who you are! Just give her some mercenaries, give her orders over the comms, and everything will be fine! As long as there are bullets for her bolter and enemies to crush, she'll be completely happy, and bullets are only available to us in this world!

![Kessoris Lyna](images/R35C5.avif)

### Nam-Kyu

Do you want a maid? No? But she really wants you! It seems this lustful beauty is possessed by some evil spirit whose sole purpose is to serve you! Oh, who knows where it came from? heh~ In any case, Nam-Kyu can control dozens of bodies at a distance of several miles and will be loyal to you even more than your own right hand. Usually, after her influence, girls perceive being your servants as something natural. So they won't stop serving you even if they leave her control zone. They'll just stop guessing your desires and satisfying you before you even say anything.

![Nam-Kyu](images/R35C6.avif)

### Kinti Diawara

She's hardly suitable for commanding a combat unit, but if you need something stolen, overheard, or scouted - Kinti will be the best choice! An experienced thief I caught in your treasure room, she'll easily find the right mercenaries for such missions and can steal for you even the royal crown, right off the king's head! No, seriously, she was damn good even before, and with a couple of artifacts and spells that I'll teach her, she'll become completely elusive. Oh, yes, she'll probably try to steal from you again and escape, but... uh... Come up with something yourself, okay? Make her addicted to your dick or something...

![Kinti Diawara](images/R35C7.avif)

### Aske Mikkelsen

The daughter of a whore, Aske grew up constantly being bullied, and her bullies often even spent the night at her house, raping and beating her. Weak and defenseless, she couldn't resist them, so at some point she just broke down and came to your castle herself. She's ready for anything, as long as you avenge her tormentors. Humiliate them, break them. She'll only be happy to become a bitch for a whole pack of werewolves if they rape her tormentors as brutally as they raped her. She also hates her entire former kingdom and will gladly become your spy, finding other bullied girls who'll tell you all the secrets of the kingdom in exchange for revenge and a bit of your power.

![Aske Mikkelsen](images/R35C8.avif)

### Antulu Pihami

Oh no, she's not a former nun as it may seem! She still sincerely believes in her god, she just thinks that stupid people are fundamentally incapable of understanding the divine plan. So if evil like you has entered this world... It means God allowed you to! It means it's all part of the great plan! So Antulu will help you with everything she can and will gladly suck your dick, convinced that it's exactly what her god wants from her. Amazingly, she can still perform that burning light divine magic... so her patron really hasn't abandoned her, even after she herself opened the gates and let in the monsters that raped all the nuns...

![Antulu Pihami](images/R35C9.avif)

### Zikka Trox

A beautiful demoness who has long dreamed of becoming one of the barons of hell... But alas, all the places are already taken! So even after a century of attempts, intrigues, and bloody wars, she remained just a contender, never having conquered the desired throne. When her gang was defeated again, I offered her to gather strength in a new world, and here she is! An experienced commander, leader, fighter, hottie, and exhibitionist who will gladly suck off a whole army of monsters for victory! What? Ah, well... yes, probably she'll try to seize power... Just call her your queen or something? In any case, I think that in a couple of hundred years she'll want to return to hell with her new army!

![Zikka Trox](images/R35C10.avif)

### Admiral Zumzrot

I just love real orcish magic! Look, this big guy put on a randomly found admiral hat and now believes he's a real admiral! And you know what? He'll actually be great at commanding a fleet, even though he's never even seen ships in his steppe, haha! Well, I think he'll also do great with a band of orcs, since fighting, shouting, and cursing is what Zumzrot does best! Just look at his fangs and menacing gaze, ah? What a handsome guy! And the main thing - I managed to convince him that an admiral is not just an orc boss or a king, but an admiral must serve the emperor. That is, you! Eh... Actually, he first tried to swear allegiance to the king of the north, but it all ended in a usual orcs raid...

![Admiral Zumzrot](images/R35C11.avif)

### Semsapiel

Shh! Quiet! Pretend I'm not here, okay? Semsapiel is a real angel, no joke! Damn, I didn't think they'd ever come down to this world, but it seems she's extremely progressive! Ah, what? Oh no, she won't fight you, she's an angel, they're almost incapable of fighting! Healing, blessings, inspiration - that's their thing. Ugh, I have to admit, her boobs are very inspiring! Ah, yes, right... she'll serve you. I'm serious! She's completely unable to lie, but still decided to pretend to be a fallen angel to watch over you and spy~ Heh, I told you - very progressive lady! She didn't even wear panties, wanting to show how depraved she is, although she's terribly embarrassed! Be gentle with her and don't scare her off, maybe you'll be able to corrupt her for real~

![Semsapiel](images/R35C12.avif)

## Mercenaries

<div style="color: #9e2323;">Sergeants are great, but I think you should still look for soldiers.
After all, no war can do without ordinary cannon fodder.
And you alone won't be able to, ah, 'take care' of every beauty in the captured city, no matter how hard you try, heh.
Anyway, I've gathered a few willing participants here...
Sorry, no great mercenaries from other worlds this time, I'm tired of running back and forth... 
it's not that easy, especially finding you again among all these similar tiny worlds!
I mean, dark lords usually make do with their own forces!
An army of orcs isn't so bad, is it?</div>


### Goblin Horde

Don't look at me like that! I didn't invite them here! Goblins just breed in any dark army like rats! However, they're about as useful as rats, too... They eat your supplies, squeak under your feet, and are absolutely disgusting to taste! I don't think even a hundred goblins could defeat a real heroine, but at least they're fun to throw at enemies and are willing to "take care" of any captive...

![Goblin Horde](images/R36C1.avif)

### Freelancers

A ringing coin can work wonders! You can turn any girl into a whore, open the gates of even an impregnable castle by paying a traitor, or... or simply hire an army of mercenaries. What are you so surprised about? People always fight each other - it's hardly their main entertainment. And even in this pathetic world, after a thousand years of peace, as soon as it smelled blood, criminals and mercenaries appeared! Oh, maybe they're not very experienced in bloodshed yet, but you'll teach them, right?

![Freelancers](images/R36C2.avif)

### Battle Slaves

Ordinary, untrained slaves are of little use in battle, especially if they don't even want to fight for you... But a little bit of drugs, brainwashing, and most importantly, weapons can fix that! Honestly, I think they're still horribly expensive units with mediocre stats, but at least it creates a truly terrifying effect when people see their former neighbors and friends growling, eager to bite their throats...

![Battle Slaves](images/R36C3.avif)

### Feral Werewolves

Oh, by the way, these guys can growl even better! And bite! Feral werewolves are great warriors, even if they have no idea about military science and are hard to control... But they have an extremely useful quality! Every bitten person also becomes a werewolf and joins the pack. Of course, this can be cured with magic, but the mental changes will already be irreversible, so the "cured" person will still return to the pack to howl at the moon with their blood brothers and fuck anyone they catch...

![Feral Werewolves](images/R36C4.avif)

### Corrupted Heroines

Not all heroines have an unbreakable spirit, and not every one of them can bravely fight monsters again and again, lose, get captured, get fucked for weeks, escape, and start all over again. Some of them give up, some even lock themselves in monasteries... Most just enjoy the process, and some most depraved bitches become not just dependent on continuous violence and sex, but break down so much that they even beg to use all their holes, and in between, they try to help you break more heroines and dry-fuck any warriors of light. Everyone in this world must be broken and submit to the greatness of monster dicks!

![Corrupted Heroines](images/R36C5.avif)

### Drones

Hah, it seems that the armies of the kingdom had too many stupid bitches who wanted "free" power that a living costume can give! Surely, in the first weeks or even months, they could still control it and fight monsters... But over time, this non-stop pleasure consumed them more and more, they got used to drinking aphrodisiacs like water, and without sperm in their womb and a pair of tentacles in their ass, they felt like an empty vessel... An empty, mindless mannequin, just a container for dicks and tentacles, a puppet for the living costume... They don't care who they fight anymore, and they're only happy when monsters rape them, so they'll definitely be useful in your army! Either as fighters or at least as meat for fucking!

![Drones](images/R36C6.avif)

### Traitors

Ha, treacherous bitches! Some of the weakest and most cowardly heroines, they would surely have ended their journey as a sow in a goblin lair, and they know it perfectly well. But for some reason, they're obsessed with the aura of glory and greatness of real heroines and are willing to do anything to be worshiped too! They're willing to secretly serve you in exchange for gold and your mark, which won't let other monsters rape them! In exchange for every loss, they'll lure a couple of other girls into your traps to pay with their bodies... Ha, it seems like they even specifically choose the strongest heroines that they can deceive to move up in the adventurer rankings!

![Traitors](images/R36C7.avif)

### Nuns

Antulu turned out to be a surprisingly good preacher! Her fiery, inspiring speeches about God's plan and the miracles she performed while being fucked by monsters made many people rethink the order of things in this world... Oh, no, heroines still keep fighting - after all, that's also part of God's plan. But a whole order of lewd nuns joined us! Just look at their tits and the shows they put on with each other in the name of their God! They might not be useful in battle, but they're ready to heal anyone, perfectly calm the population in conquered lands, and always ready to provide their ass to anyone. But their prayers are a bit strange and I can't even figure out who exactly they are praying to...

![Nuns](images/R36C8.avif)

### Demonic Meat

Ordinary demonic meat. Imps, demons, devils, magogs... all sorts of little brats with chicken brains that can only tear everything in their path... These losers will never rise, but they're damn cheap! You can buy a whole army for just a few carts of good wine or something like that. Yep, they're SO cheap. What? Oh, Anon, why should the barons of Hell even pity them? When they die in your world, they'll just reincarnate in Hell and continue serving, and the baron will have something to drink! So all the costs are only for opening the portal, and you'll be the one who spends the mana on it.

![Demonic Meat](images/R36C9.avif)

### Great Beast

It won't be easy, but I'll give you a hint on how to corrupt one of the great beasts. They're damn dangerous on their own, so if you can just direct them to the lands of your enemies to sow chaos and destruction - that's already a great achievement! Generally, this plan has only one drawback - if people figure out that the great beasts can be controlled in principle, they'll definitely try to do it too. Of course, it might take them decades or even centuries, but you'd better be prepared! Seriously, these creatures are like a natural disaster! Not just a simple one, but a magical, unstoppable storm!

![Great Beast](images/R36C10.avif)

### Elementals

Maybe it's better if you deal with simple elementals... Look, how cute they are! Fire, air, water - there's probably even one with a menthol flavor, haha! Maybe they're not very smart, but you can summon them as many times as you want while you have mana. Hundreds, thousands of elementals that don't care about their temporary body in this world and are ready to carry out any of your orders! Isn't that great? Of course, they don't exist for long, and you'd better not mess with Elemental Lords... I mean, they're not much weaker than some gods... Oh, by the way, you can also give them any form, so that the fire beauties always delight your eyes with their burning asses!

![Elementals](images/R36C11.avif)

### Dark Elves

Emm... no, these are not the night elves you've heard of. These are dark. In the light, they just disappear like ghosts and usually live very deep underground in eternal darkness. Honestly, I didn't even think they existed in this world... Hmm... Sorry, what? Oh, no, I also can't think of what to do with them yet... Maybe just trade with them? Surely they need things from the surface? There are probably whole cities, if not countries, of these dark creatures underground, and they'll definitely have something to offer in exchange, and you're the only one who'll even talk to them... Emnn, yeah, there are many very cruel and bloody stories about them...

![Dark Elves](images/R36C12.avif)

## Enemies

<div style="color: #9e2323;">I didn't want to upset you earlier, oh my Dark Lord...
But we're actually surrounded by enemies on all sides!
Those damn heroines are everywhere, and even for me, it's hard to sneak into town to eat in peace! 
Anti-demon amulets, traps, guards, soldiers, adventurers...
No one wants to hold onto my horns anymore!
Ah... just a little while ago, every guy was so eager to feed me!
Even without any illusions, they literally lined up~
Those were the good old days...
Alrighty, lastly I'll help you figure out a little bit about who your enemies are, 
and then I'll need to find a new place to have some fun...</div>


### Leveled-Up

Humans have adapted to the new world and the war against darkness. Everyone has become much stronger, and even an ordinary tavern keeper can now easily kick out not only a dozen goblins but even a young orc. Needless to say, the city guards and adventurers have also leveled up?

![Leveled-Up](images/R37C1.avif)

### Crusade

Humanity has declared a full-blown crusade against you! Knights and heroes from all over the world are now ignoring minor conflicts and uniting into powerful armies to crush your dark stronghold. And even if you repel the first wave, they won't give up and will keep gathering again and again.

![Crusade](images/R37C2.avif)

### Superheroines

What? No, I didn't sell comics on the black market! They... They figured it out themselves! Anyway, now some heroines are not only incredibly strong but also wear bright capes, come up with nicknames, fly through the sky, and try their best to be superheroines!

![Superheroines](images/R37C3.avif)

### Magical Girls

I swear I had nothing to do with this! It's all those damn magical mascots - they managed to find naive girls and turn them into magical girls! I thought there would be a couple, like in a typical anime... But there are hundreds! Maybe even thousands! When they fly in, it's like a damn meteor shower, not a cute falling star in the sky!

### Firearms

With the invention of gunpowder, the rules of the game have changed significantly. Now any maid with a gun is way more dangerous than an experienced knight and can take out a bunch of monsters... Well, it's not that noticeable yet, since rifles and ammo are pretty expensive, but new gun factories are already being built...

![Firearms](images/R37C5.avif)

### Gunslingers

Especially dangerous are adventurer-gunslingers! Some can even shoot those crude revolvers faster than a machine gun! And those gun-wielding witches who can enchant bullets before firing can blow anything to smithereens... And, damn, I'm not responsible for this! These are completely different witches from last time, okay?

![Gunslingers](images/R37C6.avif)

### Fortified Cities

Fortunately, humans don't have tanks, bombers, and all that jazz yet, but they've managed to fortify their cities with ridiculously powerful cannons and anti-aircraft guns! And if you're not a dragon and can't just ignore all their damage, you'd better keep your distance! And don't even hope that orcs with axes can take it over!

![Fortified Cities](images/R37C7.avif)

### Sisters of Battle

Um... I have bad news - humans have mastered the production of bolter ammunition... So our dear Sister of Battle is now on the side of the humans, fighting chaos, and organizing a branch of the order... Ha... Actually, it's even funny that she still doesn't consider you an enemy, but just one of the local lords... Wait, then who is she fighting against?

![Sisters of Battle](images/R37C8.avif)

### All-Out War

Listen, it's really getting uncomfortable here! Humans have gone all out, like in World War! Only all the soldiers are also pumped full of magical potions and combat drugs! They advance like zombies through clouds of poisonous gases!

![All-Out War](images/R37C9.avif)

### Midnight Dryad

Actually, they don't care about you or humans, but they really dislike how you're polluting nature! And if you don't want all the water sources around your castle to dry up and everything to turn into a desert because of their curses, you'd better install filters on all your forges and factories! Well, at least humans will have it worse, since they don't have a single leader and will be arguing for years...

![Midnight Dryad](images/R37C10.avif)

### Legendary Heroine

Remember those ancient legends about the coming of darkness and your weaknesses? Well, humans aren't too worried, since they know a heroine of light will appear to defeat you... And it looks like she's already starting her heroic deeds! She's clearly getting x5 experience and is incredibly lucky already! So you'd better not slack off and level up five times harder, or you'll lose!

![Legendary Heroine](images/R37C11.avif)

### Anonymous Angel

Wait, wait... yeah, right... This sweet angel smells exactly like you! It's also Anon! Damn angels, how dare they also make a CYOA to throw a hero here! Oh, I really hope it was also NSFW, or else I... Oh, no, wait... I think everything is fine, this slut definitely has clothing restrictions, and I'm sure that's not all!

![Anonymous Angel](images/R37C12.avif)

### Automatons

I thought all this was just legends, and there was nothing left in the ancient ruins... But it looks like there were entire factories and armies of magical automatons hidden there! They've been waiting for the return of darkness for thousands of years and are now ready to crush you to restore peace and order!

![Automatons](images/R37C13.avif)

### Berserker

Uh, Anon? We have problems! We have freaking huge problems! Well, actually, you do, because I'm getting out of here soon! No, this guy isn't a heroic hero - his soul is darker than night! He's a fucking berserker, ready to kill everyone around and burn the whole world for his revenge and rage! I don't know how you offended him, but you'd better just apologize!

![Berserker](images/R37C14.avif)

### Demigod

Maybe you too rushed into starting a full-scale war... Well, or the local gods are impatient? Anyway, a true demigod has appeared on earth to lead humans against you. Of course, he can't just incinerate you - that's not according to the rules. But his advice is damn good, so now it will be much-much harder for you.

![Demigod](images/R37C15.avif)

## Endings

<div style="color: #9e2323;">Hmm, what?
Why is there nowhere to spend the points after enemies?
Oh, come on, Anon, don't be such a child – scroll back up, pick some perks or whatever...
Like you've never do it before...
Yeah-yeah, I "officially" allow it!
Anyway, I need to run!
I've overstayed my welcome here; the paladins have had a bounty on my tail for ages!
Ha, I even collected it a couple of times by slipping them some fake tails, which just made them angrier!
But now that you've got so many enemies, it's definitely my cue to leave!
Try not to die, okay?
And don't destroy this world!
At least not until I jump through the portal, okay?
Bye-bye!</div>


### Farmer

Conquering the world turned out to be too damn hard, so you ended up breeding cow-girls. A quiet, peaceful life with the respect of your neighbors and quality sex with any of your hundreds of cow-girls! Some heroines still show up occasionally, thinking they need to defeat you... Well, you still have plenty of free stalls for them!

![Farmer](images/R38C1.avif)

### Sex Idol

You're so incredibly good at sex that heroines started organizing special raids, bravely fighting through your guards just to lose to you specifically and enjoy your majestic cock. When they filmed it with hidden cameras, you became the greatest porn star in the world, and replicas of your cock became the most popular sex toy ever! 

![Sex Idol](images/R38C2.avif)

### Pet Trainer

Over time, you found your true calling – training slaves for sale. You were unbelievably good at it; your trained slaves were worth thousands of times more than the average, causing kings to wage small wars just to get them into their harems! Plus, there's always a line of naked beauties outside your castle, eager to experience your whip and caresses.

![Pet Trainer](images/R38C3.avif)

### Olympic

It's only been a few years, but your coliseum has become one of the wonders of the world, and the depraved sport you invented to humiliate prisoners is one of the most popular shows around. Heroines now team up with monsters and train together like professional athletes. They've even invented new events for the competition! Deep Throat, Gaped Holes, Jumping on Dick from the Runway, Tentacle Gymnastics and more!

![Olympic](images/R38C4.avif)

### Joker

Maybe civilization has advanced too far, maybe you don't have an invincible dark fortress or unbeatable legions of monsters... But who needs them? Gasoline and gunpowder are cheap, and people are like puppets in your hands, so like a joker, you keep putting on big shows! Burning cities, revolutions, chaos and rampant crime! People can pretend to be good all they want, but you'll show them what they're really made of!

![Joker](images/R38C5.avif)

### Capitalist

The raids might have been fun and profitable in the early years, but eventually, they became not just routine – they became a loss! There was nothing left to take or plunder in the nearby kingdoms, and feeding, arming, and organizing monster legions was damn expensive! So, instead, you started setting up factories to at least make some money! After all, ruthless exploitation of workers, market domination, and corruption are incredibly profitable!

![Capitalist](images/R38C6.avif)

### Bureaucrat

Living amidst chaos and filth was unacceptable for you, so you tried to bring order and organize the wild monsters. Write laws, introduce taxes, organize a guard, negotiate with heroines to schedule their attacks so they assault your castle at convenient times... It turned out to be quite handy, so the neighboring kingdoms quickly joined forces with you. Now, every robber has to fill out a dozen forms before mugging someone in an alley, orcs submit rape requests two weeks before a raid, and heroines threaten to sue you for traps that are too tight!

![Bureaucrat](images/R38C7.avif)

### Revolutionary

Damn the kings and exploiters! This world has never been at peace; it's under the total domination of a handful of rich aristocrats! They cunningly stifle progress to keep their power and exploit the common people forever! When you realized this, you quickly opened the eyes of the workers and peasants! Soon, bright revolutionary posters were hanging in every village, and red flags were waving over crowds of angry workers! You united common people and monsters in a holy struggle against the exploitative kings and magnates! Together you'll build a better world!

![Revolutionary](images/R38C8.avif)

### Slave

Years have passed, and the heroines have overcome all challenges, gaining enough strength and experience! This time, they didn't just burst into your castle - they smashed your guards, evaded your traps, and defeated you in a fair fight! But by this time, the heroines had gotten so used to the constant debauchery, violence and lechery that they decided to take you prisoner and turn you into their sex toy... Bound and helpless, you suffered for many days as they mounted you, laughed and degraded you like a pathetic little bitch... But the rules are the same for everyone, so you too managed to escape, just like the heroines before... It seems the battle will now be on equal terms!

![Slave](images/R38C9.avif)

### Showman

This has all turned into some kind of hentai show, so no one was even surprised when you started selling tickets to the heroines to enter your castle, organized a convenient parking lot, and set up souvenir shops... Soon, a rather popular fair emerged, with comfortable bleachers for spectators built around the corridors with traps and monsters, and princesses themselves started coming to be "rescued" by worthy heroes, while less worthy ones were always greeted by cheerful whores in the alleyways and beer in the tavern. The real battle now was only for advertisers!

![Showman](images/R38C10.avif)

### Colonial

Damn, it seems people didn't just build trade ships! You thought that since there was only one continent, you could control everything. But they clearly established a colony on some large island! Soon, warships began to totally dominate the seas, and the technology in that colony developed much faster than on land because you had no sea monsters to stop them or even just to plunder a bit! Hell, they even made submarines, aircraft carriers, and missile boats, making it dangerous to even approach the shore!

![Colonial](images/R38C11.avif)

### Angelic Intervention

The angels did invade this world, but... They quickly realized that you weren't a real emissary of the Dark Gods, but just a hentai fake, and could never destroy this world. Of course, people still begged them to finish you off, but they preferred to maintain balance. So now, if you acquire a way too powerful monster, it's punished by divine lightning, but the angels also take away too powerful artifacts from the heroes... It seems the feathered bastards are just using this world as a safe training ground for their young! They even let you hold them captive for a couple of days before rescuing them, summoning them back to heaven!

![Angelic Intervention](images/R38C12.avif)

### Harmony

Over time, monsters became just a part of everyday life in this world, something natural like rain. Moreover, to make life more convenient, everyone started following simple rules of politeness. Fights to first blood, kidnappings only of girls with special bracelets and pay these whores out of the city's budget, free trade, days of truce, common holidays, careful treatment of the young... Different regions of the world developed slightly different customs, but overall, people more feared ordinary wolves in the night forest and complained more about foxes stealing chickens than about their monster neighbors. And you started living in your castle just like one of the kings... Maybe it's the special peaceful aura of this world that makes it so?


![Harmony](images/R38C13.avif)

### Sealed Away

This was a damn intense game - at one point, you even managed to conquer several kingdoms, but those damn hobbits on eagles... meh... Anyway, the combined forces of light, good, and nature defenders managed to defeat you. No, not kill you - you're immortal evil, after all! But they sealed you underground so that you couldn't escape for the next thousand years or so... The world returned to its previous state of quiet stagnation, great spells were forgotten due to lack of use, military forts were abandoned, and guards started carrying only soft clubs to calm drunks... However, it seems the Dark Gods never appeared, and after a thousand years, you will awaken to play your role as the "great evil" once again.

![Sealed Away](images/R38C14.avif)

### Antihero

Maybe you did something wrong... maybe you shouldn't have listened to that quiet, mesmerizing whisper... Just a couple of careless decisions in the past - and the Dark Gods managed to send several of their monsters into this world. Disgusting titans of rotting flesh overshadowed everything, and heroes threw all their strength into fighting the new enemy, but it wasn't enough. Even after training with you, this world was still too weak... And then you joined forces with them! Napalm, poisons, deadly curses - you taught people everything you knew about real war, allowed heroines to ride your monsters, your fortress became the base of the united forces of humanity, while in peaceful human lands, volunteer girls bred as many monsters as possible for the front.

![Antihero](images/R38C15.avif)

### Dark Emissary

Power... that intoxicating power was too alluring... all you had to do was give in to it, and you became mighty like a young god! Your dark flesh rotted a little, but it was a small price to pay for the power that allowed you to literally twist space! Cities were thrown into the abyss at the wave of your hand, and pitiful human armies turned into horrible monsters from just one of your glances. The very earth trembled and cracked under your feet, rivers of lava, columns of black suffocating sulfur gas, and darkness, darkness, darkness... Darkness in which even naive angels who tried to stop you seemed dull. It seems this world was doomed from the start, and nothing could stop the invasion of the Dark Gods.
