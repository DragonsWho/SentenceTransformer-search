##  

You’ve seen it, in your dreams. A grand spire stretching high, high into the clouds above. It looms in your mind, blotting out even the sky and the grass that surrounds it. There is something for you here. 

You told your master of your dreams. They nodded. Their face betrayed no emotion, nothing more than acceptance. The next day, the two of you were aboard a ship. As you approached, strange happenings befell you both. 

Your body began to feel empty. Hollow. The yearning in your mind grew stronger, unbearable. You had to be strapped to your bed, lest you sleepwalk into the ocean and drown. Your master’s form became unstable. Each day, a member of what you thought to be the crew would appear in your master’s 
clothes. By the fourteenth night, they could not hold any one form, switching between faces as quickly as they breathed. 

They explained the yearning, and the emptiness. You are not human. You are a creature, known only as a Mosaic. When you grow to maturity, your body desires to fill itself with the souls of other creatures. The Obelisk is the place to get what your soul is crying out for. 

Your master taught you to fight. To use weapons. To think strategically and to make the most of your situation. You will take these skills, and climb. Climb to fill yourself with whatever it is you desire. 

<b>You have been granted some small blessings. 80, to be exact.</b>

## Basic Power



##  

Your master explained the power of a Mosaic to you. After defeating a foe in battle, a Mosaic could take attributes from the enemy and apply those to themselves. Defeat, your master stressed, did not need to come in the form of death. This comes in three forms. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Each enemy/item that this can be done with will be marked]<p/>

## 



### Drain

From the lowliest insect, to the greatest of gods, all beings can be described. Their history can be condensed into a few grand moments, their greatest skill can be evidenced, and their power laid bare. You will take their description. You will take what lies below the surface. You will leave them without these qualities. No memory of who they are, no power, and no skill. Wiped clean, and left to grow in new ways.

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[When applied, all the features of a creature/item listed out in dot points will be yours. All of them]</p>

![Drain]()

### Fuse

Your soul cries out for something. Not power, but beauty. This gives you the chance to wear the form of your fallen foe. You do not rip their face from them, as Drain rips away their past. Instead, you merely copy it. You are a Mosaic, after all. But you can only take what is revealed to you. Only gain what you can see. So be careful in your observation.

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[When applied, you will gain a copy of the creature or item’s form. You may turn into it, at any time, and perform any action or use any power that you can see or reasonably glean from the image attached to the option. So if they’re just sitting there with a witch’s hat, you could probably assume they can brew potions. However, you cannot make any assumptions based on their description, only what you see]</p>

![Fuse]()

### Absorb

Your soul is desperate to be filled. You must unleash your true power. This lets you take anything from your foe. Their history will rewrite your own. Their strength will become yours so completely that it will feel as if you always had it. Your face will not be the one you were born with, but the one you chose to have. These are not simply benefits, not simply tools. They become immutable parts of your very existence. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[You may choose any combination of description and picture to apply to yourself. You don’t need to take everything. You can take only one dot point, and apply only one part of their picture to yourself if you want. However, doing this costs twice as many blessings as normal]</p>

![Absorb]()

## Attributes



##  

With how sensitive your body is to what you can do, this only makes sense. Your basic human body has six distinctive traits. Each one corresponds to a body part. As that trait gets stronger, that part grows in turn. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[You may spend blessings on increasing any given stat at one blessing per point. Anything that stays at zero will be slightly below human average. So if you have 0 strength, you'll be a bit weaker than the average human with a smaller cock/pussy. You may redirect the growth from any given stat. If you don’t want your cock to grow, but you do want to be strong, you can redirect all the growth into your ass, for example. This will affect all the growth gained from that stat, so be warned]<p/>

## 



### Strength / Genitals

This attribute determines how strong you are. With each point, your ability to lift, throw, restrain, and move about are increased. As this raw power increases, so too will the length or depth of your genitals increase. One inch at a time. And of course, the stretch capacity of your pussy and the size of your balls won’t be left out.

![Strength / Genitals](images/R10C1.avif)

### Constitution / Breast

Constitution determines your durability. How well you take a punch, how easily you survive a drop, how quickly you heal, how rarely you get sick, and how easily you slurp down bad food. With each point, your breasts grow a cup size too. If milky breasts aren’t your cup of tea, then you'll find a growing pair of pecs on your chest.

![Constitution / Breast](images/R10C2.avif)

### Dexterity / Legs

Sure, the stronger you are, the faster you run. Ahammer moves faster than any piece of a pocket watch, but the watch is infinitely more precise in each of its movements. That’s what dexterity does for you. The higher this stat, the steadier your hands, the better your aim, and the more precisely you move. With the ability to tear up a dance floor, it’s only fair that you’d get legs to go with it. Each increase in this stat thickens your thighs and lengthens your legs. Keep this low, and you’ll be top heavy. Put enough points in, and you’ll be leggy, elegant, and a towering force.

![Dexterity / Legs](images/R10C3.avif)

### Intelligence / Ass

Top to bottom. This stat makes your memory better, both at holding info and in recalling it when you need it. It improves your pattern recognition, sharpens your tactics, and bolsters your resistance to mental magic. As above, so below. With every point that goes into your mind, your ass equals it. It becomes fuller, rounder, tighter. Better.

![Intelligence / Ass](images/R10C4.avif)

### Wisdom / Hair

Wisdom is knowing better. Intelligence is the science, wisdom is the philosophy. What good are tactics if you don’t understand the broader picture? What good are muscles if you can’t pick your battles? What good is precision when you don’t understand what you’re shooting at? Even an idiot can be wise, because they know what works, not necessarily how it works. They take the routes that the smart one is too bogged down in details to see. With every point in wisdom, your hair grows own from your head. Even cutting it will always have it growing back to its true length. Not only is it long, but increasing this stat comes with thickness, vibrancy, shine, and hair so healthy that you'll look like a model, not like you haven't seen a shower in weeks.

![Wisdom / Hair](images/R10C5.avif)

### Luck / Beauty

Unlike the other stats, you cannot simply dump points into this stat endlessly. You may spend no more than six blessings here. With each one, you will become luckier. An explosive may fizzle out. Your path will just miss the horrifying predator. Your starving party will happen upon something edible. It is not something to be relied on, but it will certainly save you in the moments you need it most. As your luck grows, your beauty will do the same. Each blessing will increase the number of people who could find you beautiful. Once you spend all six points, there isn’t a creature alive that could look you in the eyes and deny the beauty they see. Use this power wisely. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Every second level of luck adds +1 to any dice roll]<p/>

![Luck / Beauty](images/R10C6.avif)

## Companions



##  

You arrived on the island of The Obelisk. You saw the tower immediately, looming over everything like a squatting god. You looked closer, seeing a bustling town and community that had built up around this monolith construction. Your master could not follow you any further. Their body was far too corrupted, being this close to the Obelisk. 

They explained to you that many adventurers try to brave the tower. They explained the worth of finding companions to help in your quest to grow stronger. Your master placed a pendant in your hand. It would be their final gift to you. <b>This pendant allowed you to share your power once. Absorb a fallen enemy and give the results to an ally, not just yourself. </b> Then, you disembarked the boat. You hadn’t even a chance to say goodbye before the boat was already pulling away 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Choose as many companions as you can afford]<p/>

## 



### Ysberin

Ysberin is new to being an adult, and is unfocused and easily distracted. She is here to fulfill her childhood dream to learn about the plants of the obelisk. 

Indeed, despite her naivety, her powers and connection to nature is self-evident. She remains blissfully unaware of her true power, but that’s only a matter of time. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Has herbalist training which allows her to make potions, can control plants with her mind, is able to navigate using plant life, and knows the functions of any plants you may encounter] <p/>

![Ysberin](images/R13C1.avif)

### Logan Mya

Logan wants to be a chef. The obelisk island is so diverse, he had hoped to escape the discrimination of his homeland. Unfortunately, it followed him here, making it impossible to find work that didn’t involve violence. He was homeless for a long time, and has decided to take the violent work so he can get the money to open his own bakery. Being a war minotaur, his body couldn’t stop itself being a weapon if he tried. That hefty cock is also a weapon of war, though it leaves opponents covered in a different kind of fluid. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Has super-strength, elite level cooking, martial combat training, and is trustworthy]<p/>

![Logan Mya](images/R13C2.avif)

### Luperios Yiarnomi

Sun elves are those who worshiped an ancient sun deity. Luperios herself is descended from a line of priest kings who served this goddess until she disappeared a millennium ago. Lupeiros was born with more power than even veteran casters, but none of the mastery or control. Unleashing her magic is devastating, but even basic attempts to control it will knock her out cold. She's made the journey in order to weaken her natural magic through the artifacts, of the Obelisk, so that she can train up to her full potential. Outside of this, she puts on a cool, often a bit vain front to disguise just how strung out and scared she is. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Has demigod level magical output, especially in the domains of fire, heat, wind and solar]<p/>

![Luperios Yiarnomi](images/R13C3.avif)

### Gerdir

Crystal goblins aren’t a natural species, having been created by an earth elemental way back in the day. Since then, they’ve proliferated and bounced around the world, looking for or being enslaved by the most powerful magic user of the day. Gerdir is in the employ of one such magician by the name of Lyndra the beautiful. While Gerdir is sarcastic, a bit of a sadist, and fanatically loyal to someone who isn’t you, her talents are clear. Given that you've little interest in money or treasure, you're happy to allow her to take the lion’s share in exchange for her help. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[She’s a trained thief, can store magic in her crystal hair, and extremely durable]<p/>

![Gerdir](images/R13C4.avif)

### Olive Ivo

Summer fae love honor. Like any fae, they're bound to any contract they sign, but summer fae follow the spirit of the thing, not just the letter. Olive was made an offer by a lizard. He would show her a cool trick, and in exchange, Olive would have to be kind to the denizens of this land. He hyped it up so much that Olive had no choice but to sign. The two of you met each other not long after you left the docks, and you explained the situation. She immediately agreed, and you gained her ally-ship. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Low durability in combat, but is immortal, can fly, has heat magic, and can use imprecise teleportation]<p/>

![Olive Ivo](images/R13C5.avif)

### Mello Sliver

You don’t know what Mello is, and all she’ll say is that she’s a party planner for the dead. She goes around to big graveyards and sets up a outrageous event to celebrate their lives. She only throws these once a year, so as to “keep it special”. This year, she has her sights set on the tower. With how many corpses are littered across its levels, it’ll be the biggest party she’s ever thrown. She just needs some help to get to the top. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Has zero combat experience. She is an elite cook, keeps the group’s items clean and functional, can always find fresh water, can walk on walls, and doesn’t sleep] <p/>

![Mello Sliver](images/R13C6.avif)

### Sun Aero

Born from the union of a dryad and a human, Sun is the first of her kind. Believing her to be a curse, her mother’s family drove Sun and her father away, sending them to the Obelisk. She wants to go into the obelisk because she’s heard talk of something called “the endless kindness”, a special magic that melts even the coldest, cruelest hearts. She’s a tough, short young woman with a natural talent for nature, magic or otherwise. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Knows a lot about the Obelisk and its dangers, has basic combat training, excellent tracker, crap with weapons, weakened dryad magic]<p/>

![Sun Aero](images/R13C7.avif)

### Larizz Cul

She knows what you are. A baby mosaic wanders into town, and you think she can’t tell? She can smell the emptiness on your soul. She’s a doctor. Not some touchy feely woman of the cloth, nor a tree hugging herbalist. She's got five kinds of knives, all with someone else’s blood on them. But, she can do something very few others can. If you can endure the pain, she can cut out things from your soul. For most, that’s a skill that could kill them. For you and your patchwork soul? That'd mean getting rid of the things you've absorbed you don’t wanna keep. Mind you, every surgery carries risks, so don’t assume it’s a get out of jail free card. Plus, she works for pay. She’s not taking charity cases. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Lots of traditional medical experience, soul surgeon, can handle herself in a brawl] <p/>

![Larizz Cul](images/R13C8.avif)

### Wet Boy

Asapient cube of jelly affectionately named Wet boy. This giant slime is something of a town mascot, what with how friendly and helpful he is. He cannot speak, due to having no mouth, but is able to scribble down notes using his appendages. Given that you’re one of the few who can read, he asked to join your little adventure. He wants to be an adventurer too, to have stories told about his great deeds. He’s the most inexperienced on the list, but makes up for it with boundless enthusiasm. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Flammable, mute and lacking any combat training. Aside from that, completely invulnerable, loyal to a fault, good at taking orders, and literate] <p/>

![Wet Boy](images/R13C9.avif)

### Forged Triplets

These three are inseparable. The world is not kind to artificial life, and these three have felt that for much of their lives. It’s unclear who built them, and you felt it rude to enquirer too closely. They’re a package deal, as the three of them are a capable, if inexperienced unit. What they want from climbing the tower is unclear, but seeing as the three of them are eager to help without pay, you can’t say you care.

Firstis Maela. She's fiercely protective of her family, though is otherwise easily flustered. <p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Passable tower knight, skilled weapon smith, darkness lasers]  <p/>Second is Behoth. He is a worshiper of sex, having spent much of his time in a church brothel. <p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Skilled dancer and distraction, light manipulation, sexual savant]  <p/>Finally, we have Nero. Nero has a cold, calculating logic underpinning his every action. They have no standout abilities, simply a variety of talents picked up from a long career as an unlicensed mix of geneticist, physicist, and magician. 

![Forged Triplets](images/R13C10.avif)

## Items



##  

With your crew assembled, you’re ready to approach the Obelisk and begin your journey. Before you can, you’re stopped by a wizened dwarf, who’d overheard your talks of climbing the tower. He offers you a few items that might be to your taste, with what little money you have left to spend. 

You already have a lot of things you need. Enough food for you and your companions for at least a month, water and water-skins that should keep your hydrated, some rope, an old lantern with plenty of oil, a simple bow and a sword. However, this dwarf’s wares glow with magic, and you feel you’d be stupid to walk away without taking a look. 

## 



### Tower Pills

These pills are made of loose bricks from the Obelisk and the sweat of magic users, all of which is crushed up into an edible pill. They offer a simple benefit. Anyone who ingests one is turned into a futanari. For all intents and purposes, you will appear to be a woman. You won’t become more muscular, but instead lose a bit of fat around your abs, face, arms, and calves to make you more ripped. You’ll also get a massive cock and balls, which will be in front of your pussy. You’ll also be a foot taller than you used to be. These effects are irreversible, but you’re welcome to hand these out to your team. You get one per purchase.

![Tower Pills](images/R16C1.avif)

### Hollowed Weapon

You felt immediately drawn to this one. It appears to be made of bone-white driftwood, but you know better. Even before the dwarf explains, you can tell that this weapon is just like you. It consumes magical weapons. It destroys them, and gains a new form it can transform into, with powers and magic based on the weapon it obliterated. Its space is limited, only able to consume ten magical items, but consuming a weapon will not necessarily gain its drawbacks, as it would if you tried to drain it. The dwarf assures you this weapon is fresh, and all ten slots are available for use. Once the first slot has been filled, the weapon will be bonded to you and will be unusable for anyone else. You can only buy one.

![Hollowed Weapon](images/R16C2.avif)

### Teleport Crystal

A simple little thing, no bigger than a human thumb and the color of sea foam. When pressed against skin, near to a beating heart, it will begin to charge up. After just a few seconds, every living thing in a five foot radius of the crystal will teleport the holder to a place of their choice. It cannot teleport anyone into the Obelisk, only out. It is single use, crumbling after teleporting, and will not teleport anything non-organic like clothes or items. You get two per purchase.

![Teleport Crystal](images/R16C3.avif)

### Noisy Pebble

These four little rocks look like grey pearls, being smooth and shiny. Each one fits perfectly in any ear, not being knocked out unless you want them out. They allow the wearer to communicate with any of the others in the same set at any distance. Only the sounds of the person wearing the pebble are communicated, it doesn’t pick up any noise from the environment at all. You get four per purchase.

![Noisy Pebble](images/R16C4.avif)

### Verti-Compass

No guide, no problem. This compass will help you find the way by always pointing towards the next ascension point. This way, you'll be able to find your way through to the next level relatively quickly, without having to explore and risk danger. However, be warned. Powerful monsters can cause the compass to go on the fritz, directing you towards the creature instead of the way up.

![Verti-Compass](images/R16C5.avif)

### Warding Armor

What appears at first blush to be a set of intimidating full plate armor is actually a symbiote. It will bond to its first wearer, protecting them from any form of curse. The curse will be applied directly to the armor, with you reaping the extra blessings and any positive effects of the cursed being you’ve drained. The armor will change, visually, to reflect whatever curses its protecting you from. The armor has a limit of five curses it can protect you from. Any curse that grants more than ten blessings has a chance to cause the armor to truly come alive with hostile intent. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Roll a D6 when taking draining a cursed being. If evens, the armor stays dormant. If odds, the armor becomes monstrous]<p/>

![Warding Armor](images/R16C6.avif)

### Come to the Obelisk



![Come to the Obelisk]()

## Layer 1



## The Groove



##  

With your companions at your side and your tools in hand, you make the trek out of the village and towards the Obelisk. In only a few short hours, you’re at its doors. The titanic structure looms in your vision, towering so high above you that you cannot crane your neck far enough to see it all. The gigantic doors stand before your party, and with a light tap, they creak open. A vacuum opens up immediately. With a scream, a cry, a yelp, you are all pulled into the darkness of the entryway, and thrust into your adventure.

 <hr style="border: 1px solid #000; margin: 0px 70px;">
When you awake, you do so surrounded by grass. It is far more vibrant and green than the island you just left. Above you tower monolithic trees, coated in vines and stunning green leaves. Around you are the soft chirps and growls of forest life. Prey, predators, and monsters. You have reached the first layer, and your adventure has begun.

## Power



##   

Each level of the Obelisk has its own special atmosphere, its own special power. As a Mosaic, all you have to do is to open yourself up, to let this power fill you, to gain new abilities.

## 



### Tame

You know the monsterborne respect those who defeat them. The few junglers you've met thus far have told you that much. You wonder why. You open your body up, and allow the air of level one inside you. In an instant, you feel yourself filled with power. It feels innate. Something has been added to your potential Mosaic abilities. Instead of absorbing your stunned foes, you can instead subjugate them. Their willpower is bound to yours. This tether isn’t too strong. If you mistreat your new charge too much, there will be consequences. However, there is a magical respect and desire to serve that you can now tap into. Just like you can’t fuse with something you've drained, you cannot Tame something you've used a different Mosaic ability on.

![Tame](images/R23C1.avif)

## Threads



##  

The first layer is not one to pull its punches. The air is humid, like breathing in a brick. The creature’s around you want you dead, and you’|l have to tread lightly. The only benefit to this place is that the truly hostile creatures are rare. Most will leave you alone if you do the same to them, and it’s thus possible to avoid danger altogether if you travel the right way. However, there are a few threats to look out for.

## 



### Junglers

Former climbers that have decided to stay on this layer and make a life for themselves. As this is the hospitable layer, it attracts those who wish to cast off society. There are six main tribes that rule this place, with smaller tribes scattered about. Each of these main tribes has a special contest that outsiders can enter to gain their favor. Whether that means safe passage or entry into the tribe is up to the contestant, but the contest itself is one of bloodshed, have no doubt about that. Of course, if you don’t look too tough, they may just attempt to kill you to steal your things. If you don’t seek out the help of at least three tribes, you’re unlikely to make it to the final test, which you'll need to ascend to the next layer.

![Junglers](images/R26C1.avif)

### Monsters

These creatures are not born in the traditional way. Instead, they come about as physical manifestations of concepts. Pestilence, rage, growth, soil, and so on. Some say it’s their job to keep the balance of the Obelisk intact, by ridding it of foreign entities. Whatever their reason for doing it, these things will try to kill you basically on sight. They have both their heft and their magic to achieve this goal. Even the smallest of them is twice the size of a human, and they keep growing. They don’t die of old age, they just grow and grow. Though, if you hack off a few bits, they'll go for a high price back on the island and in the world at large.

![Monsters](images/R26C2.avif)

### Monsterborne

Monsterborne are very different to the creature’s they share a name with. They have a humanoid appearance, while still having all the powers and abilities of their monstrous counterparts, as well as having a few visual similarities. Young ones are the same size as human children, but they will quickly grow to reach the same size as their monster cousins. Because of their bridge between the natural and the human, they are highly valued and revered by the Junglers. With the same natural life span as monsters, they can grow into terrifying forces of nature, while also benefiting from the intelligence of humanoids.

![Monsterborne](images/R26C3.avif)

## Friendly Faces



##  

As you and your party move through this place, you make a few friends. These people can offer you aid, but won’t come with you to the next level. None of them would be against a bit of sexy fun before you leave, though. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Pick what you can afford]<p/>

## 



### Silvy Synphia

Silvy is an oldie, though you wouldn’t be able to tell by looking at her. Her growth, far from the titanic monsters her species match, is a bit stunted. Her snake half is barely ten meters long, making her a bit of a runt. She’s had to rely on her social aptitude, becoming a charismatic nomad. When you bump into her, she'll want entertainment and a bit of food. If you can offer that, she’ll be more than happy to help your party. She acts as a translator, and has a variety of friends across the layer. She’s also a good guide, knowing the safe areas better than anyone else.

![Silvy Synphia](images/R29C1.avif)

### The Merchant

You bumped into this strange little creature along a well-worn path. They popped out of nowhere, as if the air itself birthed them. They did not give you a name, and you did not bother to ask for one. They had a variety of things for sale. The mundane things, like food, water, and extra rope were quickly added to your packs, restocking what was missing. Then, they revealed greater treasures. Things they'd found on higher levels. You had many questions, but you held your tongue. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[In an update, meeting this character will allow you to purchase an artifact from later levels early for double the price]<p/>


![The Merchant](images/R29C2.avif)

### Quilian

You knew about this one. How could you not? An ancient dragon, the size of many mountains stacked behind one-another. A beast so powerful that its fury could only be likened to a hurricane, that breathes. Some suspected that it had been there longer than the tower itself, that it was the progenitor of all monsterkind. What you have found is a beast that meets all such descriptions, bar one. It is docile, and kind. You found one of its eyes, which at first you had mistaken for a cliff face. It does not move much, lest it destroy the layer, but it had some sage wisdom for you and your team. It taught you the beauty of the storm, and a single piece of ancient magic. 
<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Take one of the Targets for free, and gain immunity to a single natural disaster you run into]<p/>

![Quilian](images/R29C3.avif)

## Quests



##  

Your new friends, and a few others, need some stuff done for them. If you can complete these quests, you'll get an interesting reward. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Roll a D20 for any quest you want to attempt. Below a ten, you fail. You can’t try again. Above a ten, you succeed, and get whatever’s promised. If you roll a nineteen or a twenty, you get the prize and a bonus of 5 extra blessings]<p/>

## 



### Threasure Hunt

On your journey, you've come across several abandoned towns, choked with vines and overgrowth. As you walk through one such ruin, your foot caught on a scrap of paper that turned out to be a treasure map. If your cartography skills are up to snuff, it will take you all the way to an island. After a lot of digging, you'll find a small bag with “Womb of the Unborn Goddess” scrawled on it. Within it is your reward, a Bone Idol Necklace. It has the ability to manipulate pregnancies however the user wishes. It can cause them, transfer them, speed them up, stop them, undo them, and even multiply the number of kids rocking around in there. The magic protects targets from being hurt by all this. Despite this, you feel that something with such a grand title has more to offer, but you have yet to discover its true nature. Perhaps time will tell.

![Threasure Hunt](images/R32C1.avif)

### Winds of Everything

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[You gain a +5 to complete this quest if you met Quilian] </p>You were told of six wonders of the first layer. A storm under rocks, a tornado made of fire, an endless tsunami, a floating earthquake, a volcano made of ice, and a sun the size of a cricket. In your attempts to find these unnatural phenomena, you will gain a bit of knowledge. This knowledge provides you the ability to summon a powerful elemental monsterborne: a humanoid woman with the powers of the impossible elemental phenomena you have discovered. She will join you as a party member, becoming yet another person who can take things that you fuse, drain, or absorb if you so desire.

### Jungler Fucker

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Requires that you’ve met The Merchant] </p>A couple of rowdy junglers went ahead and stole a bunch of stuff, without even paying! The Merchant can’t offer much beyond a vague description of what these assholes look like, so you'll have to do some tracking. If you can find them, beat them, and return all the stuff that was stolen, the Merchant will happily give you one of their secret items for free. It’s a small package that unfolds into a large tent. This tent keeps anyone inside it magically clean, and those that sleep in it will wake feeling refreshed. The tent is also well camouflaged, making it much safer than camping out on your own. If it’s folded back up with a creature inside it, they'll be propelled out of it like a dog in a catapult.

### A Tribal Path

On your journey, you meet a group of Junglers known as Teachers. They are like a class of scientists, or researchers. Learned people, congregating in one village. It is their job to help other Jungler tribes gain knowledge, by putting pupils through a variety of tasks to make sure pupils through a variety of tasks to make sure they're ready for such gifts. You wish to learn the powers of a shaman, the ability to predict the future. In order to get the symbol of a shaman tattooed upon your skin, you must complete three trials. You must cure a cursed wound, defeat a monster without any weapons except that monster’s body, and repair a piece of higher Obelisk tech without knowing its purpose. Once you complete these tasks, you gain the shaman’s power. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[With the Shaman’s power, you can reroll up to two dice rolls per level of the Obelisk]</p>

### Overflow

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Requires that you've met Silvy Synphia]</p>There’s a volcano that’s been going off for some time near Silvy’s home. Instead of lava, it was ejecting this yellow ooze. She was able to escape in time, but it’s been turning every plant, animal, monster, and monsterborne into golem creatures. Encased in stone, and unable to think for themselves. These creatures move perfectly in sync, as if controlled by some central intelligence. However, if you're able to plug the mountain, all these creatures and plants will return to normal. This will also save Silvy’s family, and she'll be so grateful she'll give you the MutaGenic Butterfly. TI shiny rock allows you to turn any outside creature into a monsterborne. It also lets you turn any monster into a monsterborne, but requires a bit of effort. <p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Roll a D20. If you get above a 15, a monster is turned into a monsterborne]</p>

### Insemination

As you and your party make your way through this layer, you hear stories about a terrible group of Junglers. They don’t have a formal name, but they're ruled by a priestess who guards the way to the higher layers. The whole group are gigantic futanari who're rumored to drink monster blood to get as big as they are. They go around, breeding other jungler groups and forcing their women to carry their children. The most recent tribe you've come across is currently being attacked, and you have a chance to help! You and your party dash in, beating back these rape-happy attackers before they can hurt anyone. Once complete, the grateful junglers of this, rescued tribe offer up a magic mirror. It can turn any monsterborne into a regular person, but only temporarily. So if you defeat someone as a human, then you could wait for them to turn back to a monsterborne to absorb their more interesting traits. Additionally, you've gained experience with fighting against the Priestesses minions, which will help later.

## Rivals



##  

Friends aren’t the only beings you’re likely to find. Even in a tower of magic and terror, the pettiness of humanoids still finds a way to make a nuisance. These ones cannot be defeated, and thus won’t be possible to absorb. They’re just obstacles you'll have to deal with on the way to your true goal. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Pick as many as you like to gain back some blessings]<p/>

## 



### Daldama

A gibbering lunatic. You’re not even sure how someone this incompetent made their way in here, let alone survived this long. Others have said they fell all the way down from “Heaven”, but that can’t possibly be true. Their one “power” seems to be that nothing can hurt them when they’re horny. They use this exclusively to try to cuck new climbers. They’ll dive to fuck any given monster, monsterborne, or jungler you try to fuck in your time here. They can obviously be beaten back, but that only does so much. Once they get their claws, there’s not much that can throw them off.

### Magnus Hvitserksson

Magnus isn’t so much cruel as self-interested. She'll hide in the shadows of a tree, watch your party take their reward, then swoop in and steal whatever she can. Money, valuables, tools, etc. She’ll only take things that you just got, rather than anything you came in with. She uses her electro-magnetism to make it easier to snatch up valuables. In a straight fight, she’s nothing special, which is why she operates on a snatch and run policy. If none of your party really cares about valuables, she’s not an issue. But if anyone is looking to get paid, Magnus becomes infuriating.

## Targets



##  

Like the jaw of a snake, you feel your soul curl open. So many powerful creatures, ripe for defeat and absorption. You begin to hunt. You and your crowd look around for whatever you can, spying some curious creatures you're sure your team can defeat. If you do, the powers of each beast are yours to have.

<p></p>With each step, you could feel the air getting colder. When the lava and the scalding heat disappeared, you were glad for the coolness you had missed so much. But soon frost covered the bare rocks and frozen piles of lava, and snow appeared in the air, so you began to wrap yourself in warm clothes. Just before passing through to the next level, you came across the tent of a traveling succubus.
