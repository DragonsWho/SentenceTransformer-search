title: demon-god of world creation En

## Demon's Blessing

When you suddenly open your eyes, you find yourself in a cozy Gothic study, decorated with antique carpets and lavish, elegant furniture. In front of you is a large desk with a revolving chair. The chair slowly begins to rotate, revealing an incredibly beautiful woman seated upon it. Her otherworldly beauty makes you exhale in admiration.

"Ah, did you say something? Oh well, never mind!" she says, her voice melodic and enchanting.

"I am the Demon-God of Creation! Why am I a demon if I create? Are you serious? Is that what you are most interested in right now?"

"Aren't you wondering how you got here? What's going on here?
What? You think this is just a dream?
Hey, have you ever seen such a beautiful girl in your dreams? No? Exactly! So it's definitely not a dream!" she exclaims, gesticulating vigorously with her hands

"Anyway, forget about it! Right now, you need to choose skills to survive in this world!" she declares, her tone becoming more serious.

"Yeah, of course you'll need special powers in this world! Absolutely! Believe me, even if you're a SWAT veteran, you can't survive here without them! You'll be torn to shreds! Oh... Yes, yes, you'll have a new life, you've got it all! Don't interrupt me!"

"Take this seriously. Here, look - next to the choices that take away points, there will be a "-" sign, and next to the choices that give you extra points, there will be a "+" sign. Get it? Hey, even you should understand this! I made it really easy for people like you!" 

"Just be careful not to spend it all at once, or you won't have any points left to use in the future.... Okay?" she adds, her voice taking on a mysterious quality.

"Oh, and one more thing I almost forgot to mention. All perks and drawbacks will be tied to your soul forever!"

"For example, if you choose the "Beautiful" perk, even if a jealous wizard tries to switch bodies with you, he won't succeed! Your old body will crumble to dust and vanish, while your new form will instantly return to your former, exquisite appearance! These bonuses cannot be stolen, copied, sealed, etc.! "

"They are yours alone, forever! Is that clear?" she demands, her tone firm.

"So what will you choose? So what's your choice? Fantasy? Sci-fi or maybe steampunk?" 

"Huh? Why does this all look so much like CYOA?" she hesitates, averting her eyes

## Difficulty

Huh? Hey, don't distract me! Stop asking about such trivial matters! Concentrate! Your entire future life depends on this moment!

Emm...

Oh, right! The amount of points!

How much power do you want?

I believe that life should be easy. But that's your choice!

### Cheater

That's right, life is best when it's easy and comfortable!

### Superman

It's not bad, but is there a reason you don't pick more abilities?

### Expert

Are you an adventurous type?

### Master

Why go the hard way? Are you a masochist?

## Default Perks

It's basic perks!

You definitely shouldn't reincarnate into a new world without it!


### Fate's Favor

This is plot armor, but it will only protect you from the basics!
It will keep you from being trapped, tied up, or enslaved for long periods of time. In that case, it won't be long before something happens and you escape. How much time? Maybe a month? But don't worry, if you're under too much mental or physical stress, you'll escape in a matter of hours!

Even if a knight tries to chop your arm off, you'll be fine! It won't fly away severed, just bandage the cut and it will heal without a trace!

### Language Mastery

Don't you hate not being able to communicate with people from other cultures?

Now you'll be able to master any language in the world, and whenever you think of speaking a language, it will come naturally!

Reading, writing, speaking, everything!
  
I don't know if you'll ever need to use it in this world, but you'll be fluent in all the languages of the past and present!

### Status Window

View a status bar that organizes all your information and statuses!

From your health, to a live 3D model of your body, to the inside of your body, to the appearance and status of every single organ! Abilities, perks, curses, etc.

There are a lot of configuration options, so you can choose how you want to display the numbers or how you want to organize the list on the front page!
 
The 10m*10m inventory is a bonus!

### Beautiful

Your body proportions, appearance, all aesthetic elements will be far above the world average.

Even if you didn't choose any of the other abilities below, you would be in the top 30%! Your skin and hair will always be clean, even if you don't care about your appearance!
 
Makeup? Skin care? You'll never need them again!

## World

So, let's pick a world!

Depending on which world you go to, you'll need different skills, right? 

Each world has a wide variety of races and monsters and so on.  Also, all these worlds are beautiful and comfortable in their own way, so don't worry about that! Hygiene and cleanliness are at least up to modern standards! Beautiful, romantic, all that! Beautiful, clean towns, wonderful architecture! You know, fantasy!

But of course they have their own unique features!

So which world do you want to go to?

### Euraria

Euraria is divided into many kingdoms and empires, where many different races live together. All of these nations have built steeples, academies, and other educational institutions. In recent years, the professions of explorer, for exploring labyrinths, and adventurer, for everything from hunting, gathering, and running errands to warfare and escorting through adventuring guilds, have become quite popular.
There has been a recent resurgence of the Demon Army, and warlocks are joining the ranks, but don't worry, the Ruby Heart Empire, the most powerful nation on the continent, is already looking for warriors.
Oh, and slavery still exists here, so you can buy a beautiful elf or a fallen noble if you like. Or you can be the liberator of the slaves.
I'm not a big fan of modernization in fantasy, but I do love a good story.

### Magitea

Magitea is a mana/arcane/steampunk world with a little sword and sorcery twist. It is divided into several kingdoms and empires, but petty wars are frequent in an effort to unite them. This has led to the development of steam machines, bipedal armored vehicles, arcane guns, magicked train cannons, and more. Various weapons of war were developed and used.
Talented people become "Arcane Engineers" or apply to become "Mecha Officers", etc. Maybe it's because promotions are faster in times of war?
Also, kingdoms, empires, etc. have an obsession with magic and technology due to war, and some countries even forcibly conscript people with magical talents.
There are also adventuring guilds and mage towers, but they're not as active as in Euraria. Oh, and in addition to the traditional fantasy gods, there's a new religion called the Cult of the Steam Gods.

### Herion

Herion is a world that has reached the cosmic level, where galaxy-dominating empires and planetary confederations that rule over hundreds or thousands of planets exist with ease.
The nations are so large and powerful that battles that could devastate a planet or even a solar system are considered minor skirmishes. If you're not into warfare, you don't have to worry about these battles because the nations are so large that they have an enormous amount of safe zones.
I think you can do almost anything you want to do here. Virtual reality? Space battles? A.I. Rebellion? Oh, sorry, the A.I. Rebellion already happened. They created the Machine Empire.
Goblins, orcs, and other monsters still exist in this world, and while the more intelligent ones have been integrated into society and can be found working in banks, the ones that couldn't control their savagery are still hunting humans like wild animals, so you better watch out.

### Other Worlds

Hmm. You don't have the world you want here?

What, you want to be in a anime world? Uh-huh. Fine! I think there are a few options here!

But it's gonna cost you some points!

## Entry method

First, choose how you want to enter the world!

### Into the World!

Once you've made all your choices you will just appear in a new world!

You'll be a complete stranger in that world, with no papers or documents, so you'll have to figure out how to explain it!

But that doesn't really matter unless you're going to a science fiction world.

### Summoned

After you make your choices, you will find yourself facing a huge group of mages!

They will be very surprised as they did not summon you on purpose, but they will take care of you until you become independent!

And they will be happy to befriend you! You may even be able to bond with them enough to do something with them, like get a job at .....?

### New Life

When you are done choosing, you will be reborn as the child of a powerful noble, maybe even an earl!
As an added bonus, I will place a blessing on you that will prevent you from experiencing any assassinations, accidents, or other crises until you reach the age of 15. In the same year, you will acquire the features and appearance you choose.
The drawbacks start to appear from the age of 10, and the effects will be complete by age 20. 
Remember that the support of a family can be a great advantage!

Things are fast and hectic in the big cities. You don't know which empire or kingdom you're going to, but most of the big cities are moving quickly towards disarmament and development. You'll see tons of people developing all kinds of weapons and building cities every day.

### Countryside

The countryside is a slower-paced alternative to the city, with an idyllic way of life and relaxed people. In contrast to the war fever of the big cities, it's a great place to enjoy the slow life. You'll find the comforting smell of grain and the cheerful greeting of local maidens.

### Random

## Summoner Faction



### Summon Hero

The mightiest kingdom on the continent has held a summoning ritual. Princesses, kingdom wizards, and priests will summon you as a fierce opponent of the demons.

Oh, never mind. You're just a minion of Zero, you know, something like that.

The body type you set here is based on your race.

Finally, add an image of your idealized version of yourself! 
It will be reconstructed for your chosen drawbacks, perks, etc. based on the body features you choose. You'll end up with a body that feels and looks pretty much the same, if not exactly the same! Oh, just don't pick a picture of a little girl if you choose a mighty muscular man-warrior.....

### Body image



### Outfit Image



## Gender

Why not change your gender?

Choose whatever you want, don't be shy!

### Man

You will have the body of a man in the top 30% of men in appearance, endurance, health and fitness!

### Futanari

You'll have a girl's body, but with a very special addition... Either way, you will be in the top 30% of girls in appearance, fitness, health, and more! And in the top 30% of men for this addition!

### Woman

You will have the body of a woman who is in the top 30% of women in terms of appearance, fitness, health, and so much more!

## Races

Now choose a race!

Each race has its own unique traits and abilities, so choose carefully!

You can choose the traits of your chosen race for free.

### Human

Humans are the most numerous, ubiquitous, and inconspicuous of all. They tend to adapt well to everything. There are many of them everywhere, and their individual differences are great. Sometimes outstanding heroes appear among them!

Humans love to discover new lands and.... conquer them, enslaving other races.

It's an amazing fact that humans can mate with any race! This is how half orcs, half dragons, half elves, half beasts, half lamia, half goblins, half minotaurs, etc. were created.

### Beastman

Beastmen, usually of human appearance with one or two animal traits. Their intelligence is similar to humans, but they have animal-like habits and impulses. They are also several times more agile than humans and have keen senses. 
They are the second most fertile race after humans, and they go into heat on the last three days of every month. That's why they often lock themselves in their rooms and don't go out during that time, because they're so easy to seduce. They have a life expectancy of about 500 years, and as they grow older, it hardly shows outwardly, but their strength and senses weaken. They are often targeted and kidnapped by humans, but they usually manage to get their revenge.

### Elf

Elves are known for their beauty and affinity with spirits. They have two to three times more mana than humans, but their magical abilities are similar to humans, though they are very skilled at manipulating spirits and are often superior to human mages. They are also good with plants. Elves have fairies that help them tend to their plants.

They have a life expectancy of about 1500 years and remain young until death. By the way, their ears are very sensitive erogenous zones!
They are just as often kidnapped into slavery, but other elves always try to rescue their kin.

### Dragonkin

A dragonkin is a hybrid of dragon and human. They have horns, wings and tails, more mana than elves, and more strength and power than humans. However, they are a very rare race. It seems that there are only ten thousand of them in the entire continent? 
Instead of pregnancy, they lay eggs. Likewise, instead of menstruating, they lay barren eggs. On rare occasions, powerful dragons can turn into real dragons for a short time.

Because of their rarity and beauty, which is not inferior to that of elves, they are considered a lottery ticket by human slave traders. However, they are not too afraid of this, because of their power.

### Demon

Demons are enemies of many races, so beware. Known for their powerful magical talents and dangerous charms, they are skilled at manipulating the desires of the sentient.

Their peculiarity is that they show little to no emotion. This gives them the reputation of being indifferent stoics, but beneath this lies more emotion and sensitivity than most other races.

Demons have no lifespan; they don't die until they killed, and as a bonus, they are immune to physical attacks. Demons are plentiful in Hell, but few on Earth unless there has been an invasion.

### Angel

There are many gods in the world, usually angels act as their messenger and sword. They are beautiful, but very assertive and arrogant. Angels have abilities to light magic and they have innate protection that is almost invulnerable to ordinary magic or weapons. They also have no lifespan - they don't die until they are killed.

However, if you choose this race, you will not have a patron god unless you find one yourself.

How many are there? I'm sure there are many in heaven, but you won't see them on earth. And by the way, they hate demons!

### Vampire

Vampires are a race of bloodsuckers. They have pale skin, silver hair, red eyes, and are allergic to silver. Because of their diet, they are very skilled in blood magic.

However, their biological clock is set to run at night, so they are very sleepy during the day.  They have a strict hierarchical society based on blood ties. 

As a bonus, they have great regenerative abilities, but they are not undead. They also have the same lifespan as elves and do not age.

They can bear children, but they can also increase the number of their relatives by giving a large amount of their blood to a someone. However, such a transformation weakens them for three months.

### Ghost

A ghost is easy to miss during the day, and at night they glow slightly in the dark. If they want to communicate with someone, they can easily become a little brighter and even almost opaque for a while.

Spirits can fly, walk through walls, and more! 

They can also use telekinesis to manipulate physical objects.

Of course, ghosts don't age or die of old age. They don't even have bodies!

But be careful. They are very vulnerable to sacred magic attacks.

### Mecha Girl

They are cyborgs with a biological head and torso and mechanical arms and legs.

Because it is a machine, the arms and legs are often equipped with powerful weapons, and their own energy and strength are very high. But you should pay attention to maintenance. Your arms, legs, and limbs may be powerful, but if they stop working, they will be useless. Besides, they can operate any kind of machinery, from cars to entire factories or even spaceships.

By the way, even though the race is called Mecha Girl, there are men among them!

### Fairy

Fairies! Cute little girls that fit in the palm of a man's hand. They are very talented in magic and are masters of spatial and illusionary magic. However, many fairies have a mischievous nature, and many get into trouble for their antics.

It is said that some mystical fairies exude a soft, mysterious charm.... I'm not so sure about that. But they can definitely see mana with their stunning eyes. They have no lifespan, but their small size makes them vulnerable to injury.

People often try to capture them as pets, so be careful. I hear they're quite expensive.

### Witch

Witches, an all-female race. Their origins are unknown. One day they just appeared out of the woods with universal knowledge and great magical abilities. Even they don't remember what came before.

For the most part, they prefer to live in the silence of the forest and study alone. But not all witches are reclusive. There is a society of witches called Walpurgis Night, and most witches meet once a month to share information and materials.

Although they are loners, if something bothers the witches too much, they will band together to solve the problem, so don't underestimate them! What, turn someone into a frog? Haha. Oh no, they don't do that. They just drop meteorites right in the center of town!

They live for about 5,000 years and don't age.

### Cowgirl

An amazing hybrid of Minotaur and Human. In some strange way, the weaknesses and strengths of both have blended together to create a whole new race! Just like humans, they can mate with anyone, but can only give birth to other cowgirls. And they're even stronger than Minotaurs, so don't underestimate them! Although they never show it...

They are usually kept as livestock because their milk is very tasty and they are extremely docile to any males, making them easy to keep. Oh, of course they are intelligent, they just like to be dominated too much. They are very easy to arouse, both physically and mentally. And their breasts and hips are so large that they prefer to walk on all fours. Their life expectancy is around 500 years.
For some reason, humans don't often have sex with them, forcing them to mate with animals like bulls and horses. However, Cowgirls will never refuse a cock and will be happy to mate with anyone!

### Sensory distraction

Normally, your keen senses are processed unconsciously, but that's no longer possible.

Hearing distant sounds or distinguishing objects now requires concentration.

### Heat

During the last three days of the month, you will be in heat. During this time, your mind will only think about sex. If you don't want to go on an uncontrolled rampage and make an orgy, you should try to satisfy yourself in advance with sex toys.

### Moaning

Now, whenever you get scared, hurt, or hit somewhere, you'll accidentally let out an erotic moan. This can be quite embarrassing, depending on the situation and location.
Especially if you're a guy.

### Cowardly Body

Even if you think you can do it, when you actually try to do the trick, your body will move stiffly as if you're scared.

You'll end up looking ridiculous.

### Urethral Joy

Your urethra is now a sensitive erogenous zone, and every time you urinate, you will experience sexual excitement that will approach climax.
Your urethra will always be very flexible, but it will always remain clean and tight, no matter how much you play with it. So you can use it as a second pussy.

### Stiffness

Your body is now inflexible.

A stiff body is more prone to injury, so be careful.

### Longer Recovery

It now takes longer to recover from a drain.

If you could normally recover all of your mana in 1 hour, it will now take 3 hours. 

### Weak

Now your strength is like that of a child.

At best, you will have the strength of an ordinary schoolgirl.

### Erogenous Ears

Now your ears are a sensitive erogenous zone.

You can even get a mild climax just by fiddling with your ears.

### Extra Arms

Now you have four arms.

It's awkward at first, but if you can get good at it, it can actually be an advantage.

### Penetrable Nipples

Now your nipples can be used as a vagina. It is easy to penetrate them with a penis or tongue. The vagina inside the nipple has the same sensitivity as a normal pussy, but it is impossible to get pregnant.
You don't have to worry about the nipple stretching and gape because it will look as good as new after use.

### Anal Weaknesses

Your asshole will now become a very sensitive erogenous zone.

Now it will be much easier for you to cum when you are being fucked in your ass than when they use your pussy.  
Try not to become too addicted to it!

### Eggs Laying

Now you'll be laying eggs instead of getting pregnant. You'll lay unfertilized eggs instead of your menstruation, and you'll know when it come.

It takes no more than three days from egg production to egg release.

### Big One

Your eggs will be so big that you'll have a hard time hiding your bulging belly with your clothes.
When you release the eggs, you'll have a powerful orgasm proportional to the size of the eggs. If you don't have 'elasticity' or 'regeneration', you'll have a hard time...

### Clutch

The amount of eggs you lay will increase to 3-5 at a time. You'll have powerful orgasms with each egg release.

If you take it with the "big one"... uh... wow...?

### Sensitive Nipples

Your nipples will become so sensitive that just pinching them can bring you to orgasm.

### Sensitivity x2

Your body will be twice as sensitive as a normal person of the same sex. 

It should be much easier to have an orgasm now.

### Sensitivity x3

Your sensitivity will be three times that of a normal person of the same sex. 

You will easily climax from light caresses.

### Sensitivity x5

Your body sensitivity will be five times that of a normal person of the same sex. 
Huh, you feel a little aroused even just by walking?

### Suspicious Smile

Now your smile looks pretty suspicious.

When people who don't know you see your smile, they feel nervous.

### Confirmed Pregnancy

Now sex will always lead to pregnancy.

Condoms will rip and any plan B pills will be useless.

### Glutton

Now you'll need to eat more than others.

Remember that your body will burn more calories and excrete more.

### Crybaby

Now you're going to cry, even if it's not a big emotional moment.
Whether it's because you've heard a sad story, been hurt, laughed, or been happy, you're going to cry.

### Petting Addiction

Now your scalp is also a sensitive erogenous zone.

Stroking your hair will cause you to feel sexual pleasure.
If your hair is pulled, you'll have a mild climax.

### Acid Blood

Your blood is now a strong acid, strong enough to dissolve most things except you.
You'll be more resistant to disease, but be careful not to splatter your teammates with blood.

### Cold-Blooded

Your body temperature will now be highly dependent on the weather around you like a reptile.
You don't have to hibernate like a snake, but you will freeze more easily and you will find it harder to move around in cold weather.

### Alluring Behavior

Now you will unconsciously make feminine or masculine movements, depending on your gender and the look you're going for.
Be careful because you will unconsciously attract others, mostly in a sexual sense.

### Pavlov's Dog

When you see an erect penis, your body automatically prepares for sex.

You will lick your lips seductively, unconsciously try to undress, rub your butt on it, and it will be quite embarrassing.

### Disabled

Once a day, at a random time, your arms and legs will be numb for 10 minutes.

It's pretty embarrassing to be immobilized in the heat of battle, or while taking a dump in the bathroom.

### Easily Drunk

Alcohol and potions will now have a much stronger effect on you.

For example, two bottles of beer should be enough to knock you out.

### Lolification

Your body will forever be trapped in the body of a 10-14 year old teenager. This will be especially fun if you chose "Everyone's Ideal" and "Incarnations of Beauty"! You will single-handedly make lolicon popular in the new world!

### Squirt

If you are slapped on your butt, belly or face, you will urinate. And at the moment of your climax, of course! Even if your bladder is empty, you will still release some... water?

### Lactation

You're now producing milk even when you're not pregnant.

It won't be sore if you don't pump regularly, but your breasts will get bigger and milk will leak.

### No Gag Reflex

Your gag reflex should be gone. So you'll be able to take larger objects more easily.

Seems like an advantage, but medically it's a disadvantage, I don't know, maybe?

### Spanking Slave

A spanking on the buttocks will give you sexual pleasure, causing you to involuntarily clench your anus and vagina. It's not a strong sensation, but it's enough to make you involuntarily let out an erotic moan when you feel it unexpectedly.

### Unconscious seduction

You'll often find yourself unconsciously making movements that are seen by your partner as strong sexual appeals.
Your partner will have a constant hard-on because of your frivolous behavior!

### Firm Butt

Your butt is so incredibly alluring that if you strike a pose that shows it off, your opponent may not hold back and bump his face into it.
Only the most strong-willed people could resist!

### Loud Moans

Even if you're not very satisfied, when you have sex, you'll let out a lewd moan that can be heard in the next room.

"Wow - that was amazing!" Or something like that.

### Presenting

You will unwittingly expose yourself to others.

It won't be fatal, but it will be enough to create flirtatious rumors around you.

### Weak Resistance

When resisting sexual harassment, you can only use the strength equal to a little schoolgirl.

This will only fuel their sadism.

### Boner

Now your penis will always stay hard and erect.

No matter what you're wearing, you won't be able to hide the fact that you have an erection. No side effects like health problems.

### Phantom Pee

Once a day at random. You'll feel like you need to pee for 30 minutes. It's just a feeling, so you won't actually urinate, but it will make you anxious...

But sometimes you may actually need to pee, so do not hold it too long!

### Narcolepsy

Two or three times a day, you will have a sudden, strong urge to fall asleep.

The drowsiness can be overcome by staying awake for about 10 minutes, but it is very difficult to resist. It does not occur in dangerous situations.

### Handles

Your horns will now be sensitive erogenous zones and will grow back even if they break. It's a real turn-on for you to have someone hold your horns during sex, and if they break, you'll feel an incredibly powerful climax instantly. Plus, you won't be able to pass out during these acts.

### Overproduction

Your production of sexual fluids will now increase dramatically. 

You won't notice any outward changes, but an ejaculation will produce the equivalent of a water bottle. Breast milk will also come out like spilled water.

## World change

The flaws you choose here will affect your new world.

For example, will monsters hunt women for "sexual purposes"? Well, some of them already do, but you can make it even more extreme!

### More Pervets

The world will have more perverts with a wide range of sexual desires. About three times as many.  Also, the laws are more lenient here, so many of the kinks don't break the laws and therefore are practiced more often.

### Monsters' Bitches

The monsters of your world will have a sexual appetite for humanoid creatures.

They will try to use their captives as sexual toys instead of just killing them. At least most of them.

### Unique Courtship

Spraying cum in someone's face or rubbing a dick against their lips will now be considered passionate courtship.
It's still a crime to touch or penetrate someone without their permission.

### Paparazzi

There will be a lot of lusty photographers here that try to take pictures of girls. You won't be safe anywhere because they hide their cameras everywhere! In the bathroom, on the street, in the locker room, even in the shower at home!

### Video Sharing

Local rapists will film everything they do to you and often post it on the Internet.
They will even try to make it look like you asked for it and are very happy to be raped.

### Social Mobility

When a woman holds a high position, she is obliged to sexually serve her subordinates. 
A queen becomes the human toilet for an entire nation, while a simple maid pleases only the guards.

### Plants' Favorite

Plant-type monsters in the world you enter will have a sexual appetite for humanoid creatures.
Animated monster plants and the like will now want to rape humans. They will even grow special dick-like tendrils and a something like sperm!

### 3rd Class Citizen (Female)

Women will now be treated as lesser beings than men.

Any woman would be obligated to obey the sexual commands of any man.

### 3rd Class Citizen (Male)

Men will now be treated as lesser beings than women.

Any man would be obligated to obey the sexual commands of any woman.

### Sex Machines

Now machines, golems, mechas, etc. often feel lust for humanoid creatures.

Whether they have self-awareness or not, mechanoids will often rape girls. Maybe even their own pilots!

### Kinky Traps

Traps in the world you go to will be replaced with non-lethal erotic traps. In some ways, this is actually an advantage.
A trap that would normally get you stabbed in the stomach with a spear becomes a trap that gets you stabbed in the ass with a dildo.

### Monsters Modify

Now, when monsters capture a victim, they don't just attack them or use them as a seedbed, they try to lewdly change their bodies.

Perhaps their breasts or thighs will temporarily grow, or their erogenous zones will become so sensitive that they will be aroused by the slightest breeze.

### Cursed Equipment

Cursed gear is added to rewards obtained in dungeons, treasure chests, etc.
Cursed gear has an obscene appearance and, in addition to high armor, has effects that increase the likelihood of the wearer being humiliated or sexually assaulted. Such items cannot be removed until a day has passed.

### Sexual Punishment

In the world you will find yourself in, the punishments for crimes will be in the form of sexual service.
For minor offenses, there are only a few humiliating slaps on the butt, and for major ones, you'll have to work as a public toilet.
Of course, plot armor will allow you to get out of this situation within seven days.

### Public Services

Sexual assault in public restrooms will now be legal. You have to be careful when you go to the bathroom.
If you are unlucky, you might be stuck there for a long time because of the large number of people.

You think it doesn't matter because you're a man? Ugh. Actually, it's worse than that.

### Sex Crimes

Sexual crimes will be committed more often. All those who used to hold back will not even think about punishment when they see an opportunity to rape a pretty girl. And the number of other crimes will not increase.... So you won't even get robbed after being raped!

### Interspecies attraction

The animals of the world you are about to visit are sexually attracted to humanoid creatures.

If a boar is in heat, it may pounce on you. The good news is that you will not get pregnant unless you are a Cowgirl.

### Groping Law

Groping is now legal in crowded places where people are physically close to each other.

Casual molestation is still a crime; it's only legal in places like crowded trains or concert halls.

### Risky Outfits

People will start wearing more revealing or risky outfits.

Normally, you'd be labeled a slut, but now you'll be seen as just wearing something sexy.

### Prize

The winner of a fight, or even an important match, has the right to do whatever he wants sexually with his opponent for 30 minutes, and the loser will be completely obedient to him.

The winner cannot transfer this right to another person.

### Pleasure Meter

The more people like his appearance, behavior and actions of his sexual partner, the more sexual fluids they will secrete, be it semen or squirt. 

So now you'll always be able to tell exactly how much they enjoyed your blowjob!

### Organized Crime

Sex crimes will be less random and more calculated. If you are kidnapped, you will be held longer, you will be better guarded, and there will probably be many more rapists. 

Also, criminals will try to blackmail you to keep you on their leash.

### Lewd Mounts

Mount's controls are now based on a lewd design.

Mechs will often have dildo sockets, spaceships will rape their pilots with numerous sex machines, and even simple animals will sometimes need to be pleased to stay obedient.

### Style

People will be able to wear their own fashion, sexy, cute, unique, beautiful, cool, fancy, colorful outfits and everyone will take it as normal.

Everyone will be dressed like anime or fiction characters, and it will be functional.

### Staying Aware

When your chosen changes are implemented, people's perceptions will remain the same as before. For example, if a woman in the street finds her skirt being forcibly pulled up by a man, even if she thinks it is right and that she should not resist, she will still realize that it is abnormal and experience a mixed feeling of absurdity and shame.

## Mental Shift



### Cum Addiction

Semen is incredibly tasty and appealing to you.
If you haven't consumed it for more than a day, you will have a strong desire to suck a cock as soon as possible and savor that taste. Every time you see a guy on the street, you will imagine what his cum tastes like.

### White Power

When a white person of the gender you're attracted to is around, you'll become increasingly sexually aroused, and you'll find yourself constantly looking at their genitals. As a bonus, you'll be strangely submissive to them, but you can overcome this with your will.

### Blacked

Being around black people of the gender you're attracted to will make you more and more sexually aroused, and you'll find your eyes constantly drawn to their genitals.
As a bonus, you'll be strangely submissive to them, but you can overcome this with your will.

### Timid Resistance

Now, brushing off a hand on your butt or screaming during sexual harassment is about as difficult and embarrassing as singing naked in a public square.
Your usual resistance will be to whisper or plead, "Please don't do that."

### Punching Bag

You will develop a fetish for being used as a punching bag.
You will experience intense arousal from not being treated as a person during sex, and you will experience intense orgasms from feeling powerless during beating sex.

### Masochist

Some of the pain will be converted to pleasure, and you will become aroused by being insulted or humiliated.

You will be attracted to being sexually dominated.

### Sadist

You will be aroused by inflicting pain, humiliating and abusing others.

You will be so attracted to sexual dominance.

### Switch

You will have both sadistic and masochistic instincts at the same time. When you win, you will revel in trampling your opponent into the dirt, but when you are down, you will immediately switch and begin to enjoy your own degradation.

### Suffocation

You'll develop a fetish for being choked during sex.

Choking causes you to piss and cry, and triples your sexual pleasure.

### Deep Sleep

Once asleep, you will not wake up for three hours unless you are attacked or there is an explosion nearby.
But it doesn't matter what they do to you or how hard they rape you. You will still wake up completely rested and full of energy!

### Smell of Dick

You have a penis odor fetish.

The stronger the penis odor, the stronger the desire to bury your nose in the groin and then suck the penis. 

### Masturbation addiction

If you don't masturbate to climax at least twice a day, you'll have mild heat.

You can get rid of it by having sex twice instead of masturbating.

### Bestiality

You will develop a fetish for bestiality.

You may have a spontaneous desire to be caught by a beast, to be raped, or simply to satisfy the lust of any horny animal with your body.

### Exhibitionist

You have now become an exhibitionist.
You will experience intense sexual pleasure in situations where your naked body can be seen by random people. You will often find it hard to resist at least pulling up your skirt in public.

### Drinking Habits

You'll develop a habit of taking off your clothes, when you become drunk.
No matter where you are or who's around you, the more drunk you get, the more you'll take off your clothes until you're naked and then you'll fall asleep on the spot.

### Hidden Toys

You will develop a craving for secretly using sex toys in public.

Climaxing behind other people's backs will be even more exciting!

### Sincerest Apologies

If you apologize for something but don't strip naked to show your remorse, you will feel that you didn't apologize properly.

It is only a "sorry," so if the other person tries to rape you or makes rude demands, you can refuse or resist.

### Easy Prey

You give in easily to fleeting desires, and even if you don't mean to, you can easily be seduced if you're in the right mood or if the person is persistent enough.
Before you know it, you may find yourself spending the night with someone.

### Provocation

You have a predilection for actions or jokes that your partner may mistake for sexual play.
You enjoy keeping your partner in suspense, such as touching their genitals for pleasure without the intention of having sex.

### Rape Doll

You will have a rape fetish.

Thinking of situations in which you could be raped or walking in dangerous places will turn you on.

### Harassment

You will develop a fetish for sexual harassment.
You will go to places where you can be molested, and you will never avoid people who grope you. On the contrary, you will try to meet them more often and wear revealing clothing to provoke them.

### Bad Habit

If you feel anxious, nervous, or scared, you will start masturbating and you won't be able to stop until you feel more relaxed. And the stronger these feelings are, the more vivid the orgasm will be.

### Big Dick Worship

It will be harder to say no to sexual propositions from someone with big breasts if you're a guy, or a big dick if you're a girl.
When a big penis is in front of you, you're likely to be overwhelmed with excitement.

### Can't Refuse

You will simply not be able to say no to any sexual request.

Whether you are a man or a woman, you would be a fool to choose this option.

### Sexual Commands

Low-level, non-contact sexual requests such as showing breasts, lingerie, and other lightly playful sexual behavior are now irresistible to you.
This is turned off when you're reading a text, talking about someone else, giving legal testimony, etc.

### Increased Libido

Your libido will increase to the level of a teenage boy. If you already had a higher libido than this, it will decrease.

What? Not enough for you? Oh, okay... Then I'll increase it tenfold!

### Shame

If you are a victim of sexual coercion, you will always be tempted to cover it up.
Even if you know that someone is sneaking into your room every night to fuck you, you will prefer to pretend that you don't notice and pretend to be asleep.

### Desire to Explore

When you see a naughty trap for the first time, you're tempted to walk into it.

I mean. You have to figure out exactly how it works! Try it out for yourself!

### Stockholm Syndrome

You will be tempted to give sexual favors to those who have violated or molested you.
The more they degrade and violate you, the more they can use you as a convenient onahole.
It resets at the beginning of each month.

### Don't Kill

You will no longer be able to kill people. Like a Batman, you don't want to kill your opponent under any circumstances. In fact, you prefer to let them win and rape you if you can't beat them without killing them.

### Sweet Loss

You will look forward to losing and then being raped.

You will have a strong desire to be deliberately weak, to make mistakes and pretend to lose, even to someone you can easily defeat.
Like deliberately tripping and falling in front of an excited orc, or taking a bath in front of your enemies.

### Innocence

All your sexual knowledge and preferences are thrown out the window.

You're like an innocent anime princess who can be tricked into jerking off by pretending it's just a massage.

You can relearn your sexual knowledge, but it's not easy to learn when you don't even know what you've lost.

### Desire for Humiliation 

You'll get a lot of pleasure from being sexually humiliated, even if you pretend not to.

You'll be tempted to deliberately expose your sexual weaknesses or create situations where you'll be humiliated. You'll pretend not to, but your pussy will get wet. You may even come when you're confronted with crude comments.

### Monster Excitement

You are unimaginably aroused by monsters that want to rape you. So much so that you'll even want to give in to it, to let yourself be overcome....
And the more often you are raped by some type of monster, the stronger this desire. In the end, you'll just throw off your clothes and obediently present your ass when you barely notice their dicks. Resets at the beginning of each month.

### Lust for Destruction

You will be tempted to put yourself in sexually dangerous situations.

If you see an abandoned cage on the side of the road under a bridge, you will lock yourself in for the night, blindfolded, with a vibrator inserted, and your hands and feet tied. Sure, you'll be able to get out eventually, but someone might find you before that!

### Sexual Dreams

Once a week you will have a very vivid sexual dream.

The nightmare will usually be an altered version of something that happened in the vicinity, like if you were drinking in a bar, it will happen in a bar.

When you wake up, the sensations you felt in the dream will be the same in your waking body.

### Illusion

Sometimes your dreams will be extraordinarily realistic and vivid. If you imagine being raped by one person or another, this fantasy will take over for a few minutes, and you will not even be able to stop it, no matter how much you want to!
Oh, and be careful. These are only fantasies, you should not be offended by them and take revenge!

### Exhibitionism

You will be tempted to deliberately display your body or erotic behavior in front of others.

You'll be embarrassed to show your sexuality, but you'll find yourself sneaking around in front of others and pretending it's a mistake.
Being caught doing things like nudity or outdoor sex will give you an incredible orgasm.

### Self-Development

You will have a strong desire to train your body sexually, and you will enjoy making yourself more sexually sensitive, enduring, and skilled. One day you will even lock yourself in a sex machine set to run continuously for hours.

You will train yourself to be a perfect sex slave!

### Secret Life

Oh, you won't really have a second secret identity or a secret life, but you'll pretend all sorts of things and make up all sorts of stories about how you secretly save the world at night. Or that you are haunted by evil succubi that you fight every night... 
You can make up a whole world, and some people will even believe you!

## Negative traits



### All Eyes on You

Now you're the center of attention without doing anything.
If you're standing next to a pop star performing, not only will the entire audience be staring at you, but so will the pop star.

If you think this will help you in battle, you're probably wrong.

### Embarrassing mistakes

Now you will often make embarrassing, naughty mistakes.
Like forgetting to put on underwear or going out in a shirt and no skirt,

What would it be like to realize that you've been walking around with your butt on display without realizing it?

### Ahegao

Now you'll have more and more intense orgasms with each successive climax.
The second orgasm will be stronger than the first, and the third will be stronger than the second.

One hour after your first climax, the count resets and you will have a day to cool down.

### Malicious Clone

You will be sent to the same world at the same time with an alter ego that looks exactly like you.
This alter ego is very lewd and sexually depraved, and extremely good at running away and hiding.
If you don't catch him quickly, it will be devastating to your reputation and chastity.

### Danger Words

When you hear a certain random word, your sexual behavior will change in unpredictable ways.
For example, if you hear this word, your behavior will change to "After masturbating, you must blow the first guy you meet". The twist will last 30 minutes, and the twist itself and the code word will change randomly each day.

### Weak Point

Your ass is now your fatal weakness.

Every time anything goes in or out of your anus, you will have an instant climax that will make your legs weak. Anal rape will be a real challenge for you!

### Guestbook

Now every time you have had sex, been raped or sexually degraded, a lewd graffiti about the act will be applied to the relevant part of your body.

After six hours, this writing will disappear.

### Gaze Detection

People's gazes will feel physical, like touching, and depending on the gazer's emotions, it could be a caress, a lewd gesture, or a violent grope.

I hope you like to attract attention~

### Snug Fit

No matter what you wear, any clothing will now become tightly fitted to your body.

If you are a woman, your curves will be on display, if you are a man, the front of your pants will be showing off.

### Can't Resist

Once a dick is forced into you, you will immediately lose the ability to resist the rapist. For 15 minutes, you will be as weak as a schoolgirl and can only hit him harmlessly with your fists and scream! Fortunately, this works only once a day.

### Devoted Fan

Now you have a raving fan who will follow you everywhere.
She will be quite strong, will take care of you and sometimes she will even sneak into your bed.

If you behave well, she will become your only loyal lover, which is rather a plus, isn't it?

### Spanked

Now, anyone you find attractive will have a temporary, strong, involuntary urge to put their hands on your ass or breasts when they see it. So sexual harassment in the form of spanking will happen quite often. Depending on the person's morals, willpower, and strength, they may be able to resist it.

### Sleep Fuck Magnets

The person you find beautiful who sees you asleep will have a temporary but strong urge to rape you.

If you wake up during a sleep rape, you will be conscious but dazed for 30 minutes. You will not be able to resist them in this state.

### Lucky People

You will often meet lucky people.

I mean... They'll be lucky enough to fall face-first into your chest. Or you'll fall face down between their legs.... Or your skirt will accidentally ride up, giving them a perfect view of your ass...

### Annoying Cleanup

Sexual fluids such as semen, saliva, pussy juice, milk, or even something else will now be more sticky, slippery, and difficult to wash off of you.

If you chose this drawback with the "Always Clean" option, you'll have to clean it up yourself.

### Gangbang Magnet

If someone you find beautiful sees you being raped, they will have a temporary but strong desire to fuck you too. So often they will join in the fun!

### Meat Toilet

After orgasm, the person you had sex with will have a strong urge to piss on you.

Be careful not to be subjected to vaginal urination or golden showers. Well, or enjoy it by obediently accepting it all!

### Crossbreeding

Now the animals can impregnate you. The child will always belong to their race with some of your strong characteristics.

### Nutrients

Now you should also consume a portion of cum along with your food at least once every three days.

If you do not do this, you will be covered with sperm every time you oversleep.

### Wet Dress

Now your sweat will be as slippery and sticky as pussy juice.
Also sweat will temporarily make your clothes semi-transparent and fit your body, making your figure more expressive.

### Molester Magnet

Now the molesters will be attracted to you.

Even those who would normally pass by just thinking that you have a great ass now will definitely try to grope it!

### Cum Covered

People you find beautiful will have a temporary, strong desire to spray you with their juices or cum.

If you are not careful, your ass may be covered in cum before you even realize it.

### X-ray

Now you will always have a translucent image of your vagina and uterus at the bottom of your belly, just like in the manga.

So everyone will be able to see if you're full of cum or if there's something there if you don't cover it with clothes.

### Breakable Armor

Your clothes, armor, and back are easily destroyed and eroticized.
You will not be injured, but the cloth on your chest will be torn, your armor will be shattered, and your buttocks will be exposed. The blacksmiths and tailors will have a lot of work to do!

### Stuck in the Wall

If you pass through a thin wall, you will often materialize with your waist in the middle.

After 10 minutes, you can use the passage through the wall again and come out of it in a normal state.

### Mind-Blowing orgasm

Now the intensity of your climax will be raised to new heights. Your moans will echo through the room as your legs tense and your body trembles with pleasure. For about 10 seconds, your mind will be flooded with an intense feeling of euphoria, leaving you feeling completely satisfied. As you slowly come down from this state of bliss, you'll bask in the afterglow for another minute or so.

### Cum Transfer

Three times a week, at random times, all fresh cum within a 1000 kilometer radius will be teleported and showered on you.

You will not be able to defend yourself or dodge the sperm before it reaches you.

### Hole Detection

If you yawn or open your mouth too wide, anyone who sees it and whom you find attractive will involuntarily try to put their instantly hardened dick in your mouth and come as hard as they can.

You have to be careful not to open your mouth too wide~.

### Orgasm Switch

Your cervix will now become the climax switch.

Every time anything penetrates your cervix you will have a strong orgasm. If the penetration is rough enough, the climax will continue every time. There are no health side effects.

### Pheromones

You will now emit pheromones that will cause others around you to become sexually aroused.

The effect is subtle, but it gradually increases their libido, and if you stay in one place long enough, they will definitely not be able to resist the urge to rape you.

### Like an Animal

From now on, you can only go to the bathroom naked and on all fours.

The only exception is if you have a powerful orgasm that causes you to lose control and wet yourself.

### Am I Dressed?

You won't be able to see or feel what you're wearing until you take it off.

It will look normal to others, but you won't even be able to tell if you're dressed or not. So you'll always feel like you're walking around naked.

### Obvious Weak points

Your partners will be able to guess exactly where and how to touch you to bring you to orgasm. They'll think it's just a guess until they try it, but they'll know all the erogenous zones that even you don't know about.

### At Home

You will no longer be able to wear clothes in your house, except for your hands and feet, like long wrist gloves or stockings. Everything else will automatically hide in your inventory as soon as you go inside.
Don't worry, you will still be able to wear them in public. Just be ready for the housewarming party!

### Speech Recognition

When you hear a specific word, you will immediately go into a mild climax.

The specific words change randomly each day. You won't know which word will affect you today until you hear it.

As long as you don't hear it a few times in a row, it will be bearable.

### Comfort

Sexual harassment can make you feel so comfortable and relaxed that you may not even want to move.

If you do not have strong willpower, you may not be able to break free, or it may take you a long time.

### Sneaky

Once a month, you must perform a three-hour outdoor exposure in a lewd and lascivious cosplay or costume.

If you are discovered during your exposure, you must submit to the sexual demands of your discoverer for the duration of your exposure.

### Multi-User

If you're being sexually harassed or something like that, the people around you will want to join in the fun.

However, people with stronger willpower or people you don't like may not join in.

### Tentacle Client

Once a month, on a random day. You will wake up grabbed by tentacles that will immediately start caressing your whole body and raping all your orifices. 
The tentacles will disappear after an hour or when you pass out from a powerful orgasm. They will even pay you the same price as the highest quality whore around.

### Pain Transformation

Any pain, any suffering you receive will be transformed into three times more pleasure.

There will be no health consequences, and that's not counting the emotional pain ... All right, well, if you want, it'll convert mental suffering, too.

## Geas

Do you know the myth of Cú Chulainn? 
No? Never even heard of him? Ah, never mind!

Geas are kinda like vows that allow you to become even stronger by placing certain restrictions on you, and you will intuitively know when you come close to breaking them.

If you break one vow, you won't be able to refuse to show your breasts, bare ass, etc. to anyone for 24 hours.
Two vows - and you yourself will show your body to everyone around you by taking the most seductive poses and spreading your legs in front of them.
Three vows and you can't refuse a blowjob.
Four - agree to any sexual act.
Five - you'll become a willing sex slave to everyone around you, begging them to rape you as soon as possible.

Ten? You'll go into a crazy heat for a whole week and literally suffocate if someone doesn't brutally rape and humiliate you. 
You'll be on your own to find monsters and pay brigands to treat you as roughly as possible!

And you better not even check what happens if you break 15 vows....

Underwear is fine, but not skirts, pants, etc. If you put on a bottom, it will go straight to your inventory.

### Lingerie

Now you can only wear expensive fine lingerie made of silk, satin, lycra, charmeuse and chiffon.
Everything else will be placed in the inventory.

### Bondage

Now you can only wear leather-like materials or bondage-type underwear that looks like leather.
Everything else will be placed in the inventory

### No underwear

Now you cannot wear underwear at all.

If you wear something, it will go to the inventory.

### Cleavage

Everything you wear will now be transformed into a form that reveals your upper chest.

It doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman.

### Underboob

Now everything you wear will be shaped to expose the lower part of your breasts.

It doesn't matter if you are a man or a woman.

### Evidence

You can't flush sexual fluids for 1 hour after intercourse.

If you try to clean it, the amount doubles and the timer resets.

### Physical exam

Once a year you will undergo a lewd medical examination.

Your body shape, sensitivity and sexual stamina will be recorded and published in detail.

### Camel toe

Now you can only wear pants that accentuate the shape of your pussy.

Other pants will be absorbed into your inventory.

### Topless

You can no longer wear a top.

The underwear is fine, but the top will just get sucked into your inventory.

### Fake tail

Your tail is now replaced by an anal plug.
It still feels like a tail, you can wag it, stroke it... but it's inserted into your ass.
As long as you are not wearing a butt plug, any beastman will perceive you as a sex slave.
The tail plug can be summoned and is always clean.

### Butt plug

You must wear the anal plug for at least three hours a day. The anal plug can be summoned and will always be clean.
If you don't wear it, the next day hot semen will be beamed directly into your ass at the rate of two liters per hour, which will leak out of your anus. The only way to keep it inside is to plug your ass and enjoy your inflating tummy.

### Anal hook

You must now wear a choker and attached anal hook for 3 hours a day. It can be summoned at any time. 
If you don't wear it, a portal will appear the next day for the remaining three hours, through which you will be raped by horny goblins. So... you can actually not wear it at all if you like!

### Bullet vibrator

You must have three active rotors in your vagina, clitoris, anus, nipples, or penis for at least three hours a day. For every hour of absence, the portal to your lower half will be connected to the tentacle monster. It has tiny tentacles, so it can not stretch you to the limit, but they release the most powerful aphrodisiac and irritant, which will make your pussy unbearably itchy for a long time.

### Restraint magnet

When enemies capture you, they will tie you up in lewd ways.

As an added bonus, you will often find yourself tied up for ridiculous reasons.
You'll get tangled up in jump ropes or vines, your jacket will be pulled up after an awkward fall, exposing your chest and tying your hands, etc.

### See-through

While you're wearing all your gear, costumes, etc, it will be strangely see-through.

Everyone behind you will be focused on looking at your ass.

### Trick or threat

The pranks played on you will be overtly sexual. With your eyes closed, they will fondle your breasts from behind or pinch your nipples, etc. You will have to take it because everyone, even your friends, will be shocked if you start to resist. It's like responding to a polite greeting with a slap in the face!

### Butt in chair

Now that you are wearing a skirt, every time you try to sit on a chair, it will ruffle up or get shorter and you will sit with your buttocks bare.

No matter how long your skirt is, you will have to get used to your bare skin touching the chair.

### Short skirts

You can now only wear skirts that are short enough to barely show your cunt.

If you wear a skirt that is not, it will automatically shorten while you are wearing it.

### Piercing

For three months, you'll wear heavy visible piercings on your nipples and clitoris. 

After that, you're free to remove them. There will be no side effects from the piercings, such as sagging. Hope you like them and keep them!

### Hard-on chairs

Now every time you sit in the chair, there will be a cock on it that will penetrate your hole through any clothes you have on
You won't see it from the outside, as if you were just sitting in the chair, but you will feel a hot hard pulsating cock inside you until you stand up.

### Bad words

Every time you say a hurtful word or a swear word, your pussy gets a whip blow, causing moderate pain that can bring you to orgasm.

The whip is immaterial and invisible, so if you behave naturally, those around you won't notice anything.

### Easy targets

You will often be kidnapped for sexual purposes.

You may be grabbed from behind while walking down the street, or you may be given sleeping pills in the food at an inn you visit. Always be careful. Or just get used to it!

### Defenseless

You can no longer close the doors to the bathroom, restroom, locker room, etc. when you use them. 

Now it is not your private space, so at any moment anyone can come in or just look at you.

### Submissive

You will be very submissive during penetration. 

As long as someone keeps his penis inside you, you will be very submissive and will not be able to resist your partner's sexual advances.

### Judge

Have you heard of the "orbital laser cannon"? A beam of light that can destroy an entire city at a point of your choice.

The attack of this optical weapon lasts for 10 seconds, and if you change the target during the attack, the beam can move at breakneck speed, burning entire regions. It is ideal for large-scale destruction.

### Realm

You can create your own realm in which you can change the laws of physics, concepts, ideas, and anything else you want.

All attacks will have no effect on you, and your attacks will ignore all your opponent's defenses.

For a limited time, you can take on the appearance and abilities of the monsters that ruled the primordial world. They were powerful beings.

The duration depends on your power.

### Beauty is Power

Your strength will be proportional to your beauty, and flashy effects are a bonus.
Slender delicate hands, which at first glance will not lift a sword, will be able to hit harder than a fighter, trained for thousands of years, and charming mouth, which is as if created for kisses and blowjobs can sing spells that will change the world. If you're beautiful enough, who can stop you?

Their power depends on rank, and if you are mortally wounded, one of your summoned forces will take damage and be summoned back. You are invincible until you lose all of your servants.

### Carefree

If you don't like the darkness of the world, how about this: I can turn it into an anime.
There would be no serious injuries and casualties in violent battles, people would easily make up after any serious quarrel, there would be no such thing as illness or injury.
How about partying in the evening with the nemesis you fought in the morning, and then surf the next day during the tsunami?

### Human Hymn

You don't need to know your opponent's location or estimate their distance, just shoot at whoever you want to hit, and they'll fly for 10 seconds, no matter how far away or where they are.
The arrow's damage is proportional to the distance, and depending on the distance, it can be faster than the speed of light.

You can delay completing them for up to three months if you wish, or take the initiative to start them before the system forces you to.

This quest is mandatory, so if you try to avoid it or run away, you will be transferred or forced to complete it.

You will be completely anonymous for the duration of the quest, and your friends who meet you on the quest will not recognize you at all.

At the end of the quest, you will be transported to a safe place and fully healed. In addition, no one will know that you did anything during the quest unless you tell them yourself. 

### Monster  Book

For seven days you will be the sex slave of a big-bellied, horny, depraved bishop in a church.

### Inflection Points in History

The queen of the kingdom of Karan is about to be kidnapped.
You must prevent her kidnapping or make her your own slave.

Most of it will burn up in the atmosphere, leaving only three fragments to reach the ground.

You have 10 years to collect these fragments and merge them into one, or destroy them all.

For three days you will be confined to a toilet in a men's room deep in the slums.

### Great Forest Pioneers

You must conquer the "Great Forest" in the southern part of the continent, which is occupied by horny monsters, and build a city the size of a district inside the forest, which must be maintained for three years.

With your skills, conquering and building the city shouldn't be too difficult, but gathering the inhabitants may prove to be a challenge.

### Testing 

You've been asked to participate in a performance test of a customizable recliner built by an eccentric mechanic.

Oh, I forgot to mention, this chair is classified as a sex machine.

### Magic Must be Free

The Great Witch, this time the chairwoman of the Valfurghis of Magitea, doesn't like the recent policies of nations to hide magic and suppress wizards.
Help her to ensure that the witches are not interfered with by any nation.

You can do this by rallying the witches to make an example of them, or by winning the approval of the heads of state.

### New Restraints

For three days, you will participate in the testing of the Kingdom's new criminal restraints.

As a bonus, passing soldiers and others will sexually assault you, but they will be punished after the test is over.

### Bishop's Toy

For seven days you will be the sex slave of a big-bellied, horny, depraved bishop in a church.

## Herion Quests

You can delay completing them for up to three months if you wish, or take the initiative to start them before the system forces you to.

This quest is mandatory, so if you try to avoid it or run away, you will be transferred or forced to complete it.

You will be completely anonymous for the duration of the quest, and your friends who meet you on the quest will not recognize you at all.

There is an anti-government coup on your planet.

Choose your side of the war between the government and the rebels and make sure they win.

A meteorite that came out of nowhere has destroyed your colony's engines and is about to fall on your city.

Stop the colony from falling or evacuate it and all its inhabitants to safety.

For seven days, your job is to be the battleship's sexual health care provider and the crew's toilet.

From an undiscovered part of the universe, a space fleet of unprecedented power has invaded your system.
Together with the planetary government, defeat them or negotiate new friendships with them.

### Exceptional Commanders

You'll be sent as a fleet commander in a marginal combat zone. You'll have a total of 300 ships at your command, and the enemy has 350.
If you win, you can retain your position as fleet commander if you wish, which is roughly the rank of brigadier general.

### Goblin's Toy

To stop the wild goblins of space from playing nasty tricks on people, you have agreed to be their sex slave for a week.

You will have intense orgasms every time you refuse to comply with the goblins' sexual demands.

### No Signal

We've lost contact with the 5700th floor of the space elevator, and you're sent there alone to find out what's going on.

It shouldn't be anything terrible, as everything is fully functional.

### Rampaging Titan

A pilotless Titan has somehow gotten out of control.

It's still in the desert outside the city, so it hasn't done much damage, but at this rate it's going to reach the city, and you need to stop it.

### Return of the Ancient One

The gods of the Fantasy Age are returning, and the first to do so is the God of Regeneration and Creation.

He made a spectacular comeback by bursting the star he was sealed in.

His resurrection will send meteorites flying across the universe, some of which will hit your planet directly. You must stop them.

### Star Whore

You have 6 months to create a streaming broadcast that has two simultaneous streams.
Your top half will be streaming normal games, conversations, music, etc. and your bottom half will be streaming masturbation with a sex toy during the stream.
You can continue streaming after the quest is over if you wish, but your privacy may not be guaranteed.

### AI in Love

It seems the main collective AI on your planet has recently fallen in love. Or is she just dreaming of true love?

It won't tell you exactly who it's in love with, but perhaps you can help it find love?

If you succeed in this task, you'll reap huge benefits for the electronics on your planet.

### Space Cultural Exchange

For the purpose of cultural exchange, you are to spend three days as a sex slave to an alien creature.

This alien being has the intelligence of a wild goblin and is in heat 12 hours a day. How did they even get into space?

After seven days you can escape on your own and return to safety.

## Quests add-ons

If you wish, you can earn more points by placing additional restrictions on the quest.

As with all quests, no matter how bad things get, these quests will not harm you physically or mentally.

No matter where you end up you will be teleported to safety after the time limit stated in the quest or after seven days.

### Virgin Savior

During the entire duration of the quest, you must prevent the goblins from using your vagina.
This can be a difficult task, as goblins are very persistent. Maybe triple anal will do the trick?

### Nun's Secret

Do not let anyone see your lewd behavior with Bishop.
The bishop likes to leave you tied up, so it can be quite difficult. Try not to moan too loudly and ask to be taken to the darkest dungeon.

### Real Badass

Sex offenders on a prison island? They're all assholes. Show them who the real boss is.

Remember, everyone on Prison Island is a criminal, even the guards.

### Your Love is Me

Make the AI fall in love with you. Let her know that you are her true love.

If you fail, it will be awkward to interact with her.

### Fight

One of the shards ended up in the hands of an old legendary warrior! Put yourself on the line and fight him in a sparring match!

### Can't Stop Me

What? They tried to shackle you with those funny metal things? Break all those restraints they put on you!

Show them that there's nothing in the world that can bind you!

### Galaxy Venus

You need to gain at least 3 trillion subscribers.

There are a lot of people in Herion, so if you have charm, it shouldn't be too difficult.

### Historical Moment

The enemy fleet will double in size and enemy soldiers will become elite.

If successful, you will progress to the next level.

### Reversal

Huh? He will fuck you? Heh, it looks like he still doesn't get it...

Show that bastard that now he's the prey and you're the hunter! Make him run in panic and suffer!

### Team

Hmmm... Damn northerners... Why save those bastards? Wouldn't it be better to join forces with the Dragon and defeat them all?
After all, the dragon is so strong that if you team up, it will be impossible to defeat you!

## Cheater Abilities

What is this hidden option? Hoo-hoo-hoo... Yes, it's a list of real cheat powers! A cheater has to have cheat powers!

What? Aren't the powers you've chosen so far cheats? Absolutely not! "True" cheat abilities are "different"!

They are special abilities that only cheaters have!

### Master Access

Now you can view the status of not only yourself, but all living and non-living beings, phenomena, etc. You can view all activities, memories, surface thoughts, etc. in a journal, view and change your erotic status, statistics, skills, abilities, internal body states, 3D bird's eye view, relationships, crushes, deviations, etc. You can also copy yourself skills, abilities, etc.
However, the more complex the modification, the stronger the effect of modification or copying, the more time it will take (up to 1 hour per item). You must be within 10 meters of your opponent to change their status.

### Avatar Change

You will have 12 fully customizable avatars: gender, appearance, race, age, etc. You will be able to switch into any body at any time, just like in the game.

If you take fatal damage, you will automatically switch to a healthy avatar, and the damaged body/avatar will be fully restored after 24 hours.

As an added bonus, you can save your favorite outfits, gear, etc. and change them on the go, just like in the game.

### Penalty Shop

You will have access to the "Penalty Shop" where you can disable/remove fines of your choice by completing certain tasks or quests.

For example, you'll be able to disable/remove fines by completing lewd quests or goods, such as making 500 people cum or collecting 50 liters of semen to remove a 5 point penalty. You can also acquire abilities, skills and more that you can't get here.

### Growth System

You will no longer be hampered by physical damage, aging, etc. unless your HP is reduced to zero, pain will be greatly muted, you will be able to sleep anywhere and in any condition, any injuries or disabilities will heal quickly over time, and you will not be subject to overly negative mental effects such as fear or severe depression.

Fears, hypersensitivity, etc. caused by mental changes, physical changes, etc. caused by punishments will be suppressed by half or less. You won't be as badly damaged mentally and physically.

A level system will also be introduced, where you will gain experience when you complete a task or kill someone. When you gain enough experience you will level up, and if you work hard enough you will gain powers that even gods can't match.

### Save-Load

You will have the ability to save/load, with the first save being a load-only save that cannot be overwritten/deleted, etc., it is saved immediately upon entering the world, and the other nine being free saves/loads that you can save/load at will.

Even if you are not dead, you can always return to the save point, which can be used as a kind of time travel.

When you return to the save point, all negative effects, ailments, injuries, mental illnesses, etc. are completely removed and healed. All accumulated magical abilities, powers, skills, etc. remain intact and enhanced.

## Superman Abilities

Huh? What's this hidden option? Whoo-hoo-hoo... Yeah! If you're superhuman, shouldn't you have superhuman powers?

Hmm? Aren't the powers you've chosen so far superhuman? Of course they are, but the powers you can choose from here are a step above that.

### Superhuman Resistance

You will be highly resistant to disease, injury, poison, fear, paralysis, physical attacks, magical attacks, and more.

It will be very difficult to penetrate your body or mind. 

### Beyond the Sky

Philosophy, literature, art, music - take your pick.

You will always have skills and knowledge that are one step above the top of your field.

### Gifted

You can learn anything quickly, as long as it doesn't push you beyond your limits.

If you want to, you'll pick things up quickly just by watching or experiencing them.

## Expert Abilities

Huh? What's this hidden option? Huh... Shouldn't a master have a mastery ability?

The powers I chose above are good, but don't you think there's something more?

These are the next tier up.

### Unity

As long as you're good at offense, you'll be good at defense.

Even if you only practice offense or defense, you'll naturally become good at both.

The speed at which you learn and master something will increase.

### Moment

At crucial moments, the world will seem to slow to a near standstill.

You'll only be able to move as slowly as you can wade through water, but you'll also be able to perform stunts that normal people could never pull off.

### Grace

Everything you do will now be done with a certain level of dignity, charisma, and class.

Many people, including aristocrats, will marvel at your graceful gestures as if you were a born noble.

## Master Abilities

What are these hidden abilities? They're a bit more powerful than the abilities you chose above.

Perhaps they can help.

### Exceptional

Using skills and abilities will become easier and more fun.

What others find difficult and fail to do will be as easy for you as drinking water. 

### Successful

Often you will make amazing progress in your practice and improvement of your skills.

Often the results are more surprising than you expected.

## Power Source

Now we're almost to the last choice.

You must choose the source of your abilities.

Mana, Ki, Body, Will, Soul.

Which one do you want to choose? You can even choose multiple!

### Mana

You'll be using abilities based on the world's abundance of mana.

It's a versatile and readily available resource, but if you run out of mana, you're in trouble.

### Ki

You'll be using abilities based on the world's abundance of chi.

It's a versatile and readily available resource, but if you don't have any chi, you might be in trouble.

### Body

You'll be using abilities based on your physical body.

You don't need mana or chi to use your abilities, which is a bit of a bummer.

### Will

You'll be using abilities based on your willpower.

This is great, but increasing your total amount of willpower can be a challenge.

### Soul

You will use powers based on your soul. You can use them an unlimited number of times without worrying about resources, though it may take some practice to increase the number of powers you can use at once, but you will learn quickly. Abilities and memories are permanently imprinted in your soul, so everything stays with you after death and rebirth.
Aren't there almost no penalties? Well it's not cheap.

## Overpowers

Wow! You must have taken a lot of punishment to open this option!

And it's not for nothing! This is where you can select a very special ability: the Shard of Omnipotence.

And the Shard of Omnipotence is not something you just give away. If you want it, you'll have to work hard to get it.

Do you have enough points? Will you be able to choose more disadvantages?

The choice is yours. 

Note that you can't use one of these abilities to stop another. And you cannot take more than 2.

### Shard of Omnipotence - Spacetime

Total domination and control over time and space.
Of course, you will be immune to paradoxes, etc., and if you wish, you can turn back time to change the past, become younger by preserving memories, or create an infinite time loop.
Oh, and the only caveat is that you can't use this ability to change the choices you've made. Don't even dream of it!
But you can even create parallel worlds where the timeline splits.

### Shard of Omnipotence - Creation

It's the ability to create something out of nothing, and if you're good enough, you can create anything you want.

Legendary armor, an elixir, a portal to another dimension, a resurrection potion, a skill-enhancing potion, a simple dessert, a mansion, or even a creature from places you can only imagine.

You can even create intangible things like concepts.

Justice? Gravity? Creation is not necessarily limited to matter.

It's the closest thing you can get to omnipotence, albeit indirectly.

### Shard of Omnipotence - Chance

The power to completely dominate and control probability.
It could be as simple as winning the lottery, or getting a perfect score on 10,000 10-item multiple choice questions.
You could heal someone with a cold by giving them a 100% chance of the cold virus going away on its own, or change the color of a puppy by giving it a 100% chance of regaining its pigment,
It's a power that can be used in many ways, and in some ways it's related to luck.

### Shard of Omnipotence - Infinite

It's a force that leads to infinity.
Entropy? Silly. Humans measurements mean nothing.
It goes without saying that you can make things like willpower, mental strength, and physical strength infinite, and you can also make things like mana infinite. Can you feed the whole world with five loaves of bread? Easy!
Extract the energy to move the universe from a 1.5 volt battery, smash planets, and tear the universe apart with the infinite power of a slight fist shake.

### Shard of Omnipotence - Transcendence

The power to control and master evolution.

Everything. Mental, physical, whatever, not to mention abilities. It will continue to evolve at a tremendous rate forever if it wants to.

You could turn a cat into a tiger, a tiger into a dragon, a dragon into a space whale, and a space whale into a star eater.

And even abstract things like abilities can be improved endlessly.

## Over Penalty

Not enough points...?

Well, you've unlocked Overpower, so that might be it.

Okay, there's another way to earn points, but it's not as easy and silly as the drawbacks you've seen so far.

You'll get points for choosing a really dangerous and deadly penalty.

Choose carefully, these punishments are impossible to cheat.

### Horsemen of War

The world in which you exist will always be at war.

No matter where you go, there will always be a war going on or about to break out, and I don't recommend getting lulled into a false sense of security that your powers can stop it.

In an interdimensional war, no matter how powerful you are, will you be able to stop or hide?

If you want to end the war, you'll have to unify the dimensions while maintaining a complete dictatorship.

### Nemesis

You will have an incredibly powerful opponent who will do anything to take you out.

This opponent will have a "+20 points you spend" build and will intimidate you with his almost emotionless robotic demeanor and impeccable combat skills.

While fighting Nemesis, you'll both lose the ability to save/load, so you'll want to have an alternate means of resurrection.

It's not a good idea to fight her head-to-head, as she'll basically have more skills than you and none of your penalties.

Nemesis may be a pretty girl, but you'd better stop thinking so hard, you don't have the ability to charm her.

### Damocles' Sword

If you have enough strength and ability, you should have enough risk, right?

There will always be a giant sword of Damocles hanging over your head, and every time you show weakness or fail, the string will gradually break.

When the string is broken, the sword will fall on you, destroying a 300 kilometer radius around you without a trace. The sword will reappear with you when you resurrect.

Its destructive power is five times greater than anything you can do with your abilities, and I tell you that it is useless to try to stop or avoid it.

### Nature's Fury

All the forces of nature will try to destroy you.

When it's raining, lightning will strike you, earthquakes will try to swallow you up, and waves will turn into tsunamis that will crush you.

If you feel confident enough to take the full brunt of nature's wrath, you can try.

But I doubt your neighborhood, buildings, etc., will remain.

Can a mortal withstand cosmic malevolence?

### Unleashing Evil

Another evil version of you will exist within you.

It will try to take over your body all the time, and if you lose consciousness or control, it will take over your body for seven days.

I recommend that you do not joke about being evil.

Seven days is enough time to burn to ashes everything you've ever loved, hated, created, feared, saved, and more if you choose enough powers.

## Companions Euraria

Finally, the last choice! This is where you get to decide in advance who you are going to get really close to in the world you are going to.

Once you get to the world of your choice, you'll have the opportunity to become incredibly close to them. Almost soul mates? You'll be so close that you'll be willing to put yourselves in danger for each other.

The harder it is to get to know them, the more points they're worth. And some are really hard to meet. After all, it's hard to get to a girl who lives in the middle of a magma lake that melts with magic, isn't it?

### Lelenia "I has a Lot of Friends"

She is a demon who is shunned by many races, but who prides herself on having many friends.
Who are her friends? A teddy bear her mother bought her when she was 5 years old. The plant in her room that she named. The dragon she sleeps with all the time. 
And you can be her friend too!
Oh, and she's a master swordsman. She can cut through mountains with a single stroke.

"Oh. That thing about me having a lot of friends... that's actually a lie. You won't hate me for that? Please?"

### Yurimina "Sage"

She's a sorceress who was trained to be a "sage" in a group of warriors fighting demons.

But instead of wandering all over the place, she likes to create perfect buildings in beautiful places and spend her free time dipping her feet in the water.

However, at the urging of her teacher, a former mercenary mage, she is waiting for the opportunity to join a group of warriors.

"I'd rather be home."

### Amelia Luna "The People's Saint"

Granddaughter of a great duke who owns fertile lands, a huge military and a lot of money.

She is innocent and caring, not spoiled by the duke's excessive tutelage.

She is loved by the people for her kind heart and beautiful looks.

"Oh... such a sad thing should not exist in the world. Butler? Take care of it!"

### Rettelite "Sealed monster"

She is the true ancestor of vampires, sealed long ago. The oldest vampire.
No one remembers why she was sealed, but she's still being punished: kept in an underground cave, chained with silver chains and forced to walk constantly without sleep or rest so she can't regain her strength.
She is a bit weak and very lonely.

"Hoo hoo... are you the new vassal? Come and rescue me and I'll give you immortality! I'll show you the beauty of the night! Eh, eh, eh? Don't go! Please unchain me! I'm sorry, I'll do whatever you say! My feet hurt so much..."

### Nertheroreron "Lone Dragon"

A dragon that is over 3,000 years old.

Despite her mischievous nature, after having fun, she always wonders if she has gone too far in her pranks.

Despite its appearance, this dragon is a bit soft-spoken.

Although she can single-handedly destroy an entire kingdom.

"Haha, are you surprised? Tell me, wasn't that a bit too much? I'll be more careful next time."

### Eraritte "Madwoman"

She's the High Witch, the head of the Witch Council for this year's Walpurgis Night.

She may be a bit neurotic and obsessive, but her magical skills are unrivaled in the Empire.

She always seems to be angry, but that may be a necessary evil if you want to control a group of witches with strong individual play.


"(Tsk, tsk, tsk,) So when is the research material I told you about coming?!!!"

### Mayuni "a Lot of Real Friends"

She's a great witch who loves to party.
While her magical skills are certainly formidable, they pale in comparison to her party-planning skills. She's always throwing and attending parties, and her great sense of humor and attention to detail make her incredibly popular.
If she's in danger, she has friends across the kingdom who will fight for her without asking why.

"What? Jaxon! I haven't seen you since the party three years ago! Good to see you!  Nellie, did you enjoy your trip last week? Carl, congratulations on joining the Knights!"

### Haminia "Bathes in Hot Water Even in Summer"

She is a fire mage who serves the Fire Elemental King.

When it comes to fire-related magic, she is unrivaled in the world.

She's always laid-back and easy-going, but when she's angry, her words and actions tend to be very intense and fast.


"What? You're a fan of hot showers in the summer too? You know the part where we're best friends from today?"

### Yumite "Exhibitionist Elf"

She is an elf who loves to tease humans who fantasize about elves.

She's an exhibitionist, and her hobbies include deliberately bathing in waterfalls that human men often pass by, and casually striking up conversations with them in her soaked clothes.


"Hehehe. He's obviously excited to see me, look at his helpless face. Hehe."

### Yuna "Succa"

The most beautiful succubus in several neighboring worlds! Well... She's also the most brazen and lustful! For sure!
She would love to turn any of your adventures into an endless stream of debauchery and kinky sex. Even if you leave her alone in a completely empty and locked room - she will find someone to suck off, so she will definitely feed herself. Maybe she'll even share some cocks with you!
In her rare free time from sex, she likes to lay around, play games, run across different worlds and CYOAs.

"Oh, hi Anon! Mmm... Your lust is so sweet tonight! Keep wanking!"

## Companions Magitea

Finally, the last choice! This is where you get to decide in advance who you are going to get really close to in the world you are going to.

Once you get to the world of your choice, you'll have the opportunity to become incredibly close to them. Almost soul mates? You'll be so close that you'll be willing to put yourselves in danger for each other.

The harder it is to get to know them, the more points they're worth. And some are really hard to meet. After all, it's hard to get to a girl who lives in the middle of a magma lake that melts with magic, isn't it?

### Atrice "Dancer of Death"

She's an assassin who uses a magic string as her main weapon, and many people have fallen victim to her beauty and dancing.

She's pretty cool and doesn't pay much attention to her surroundings, but she does like cute things.


"Ah. Cats."

### Betelgena "Double shotgun"

An unusual gunslinger who carries two single-barreled shotguns.

She's quite energetic and is actually better at beating people with shotguns than shooting.

Her shotguns are harder than most clubs.


"I hit you with a gun, so I'm a gunslinger, right?"

### Nelia "Seductive"

She's been called "seductive" by those around her, but she's not much of a seducer.

It's just that, in keeping with the traditions of her elven tribe, she wears only jewelry instead of clothing.

She's chaste and energetic.


"Huh? Want an apple? I just picked one."

### Ella "Machine God Cardinal"

She is a Cardinal of the Cult of the Machine Gods, and controls the largest city in their territory.

She is a powerful techno-magician in her own right, and the entire city is her handmaiden.

She prefers fruit juices to alcohol and is a very calm person.


"Worshiping machines doesn't mean you have to turn yourself into one, does it?"

### Rep "Melody"

She is a Half-Fey, a human-fey hybrid.

Her music is known for its beauty, but she is also a master of the craft.

A single note from her can bring down a small city.

She can compose as well as perform, and has an artisanal approach to music.


"What! You like music too?! Get ready to play with me, quick!"

### Erin "Sweetie"

She's a catgirl favored by an Imperial Duke.

She has a sweet disposition, is easily startled, and has a habit of letting out cute little moans.

If you sneak up on her and startle her, you'll see her jumping up and down and yelping "Nyan!".


"Heeeeeek!"

### Lelenia "Innocent Elf"

She is the daughter of a powerful elder of the high elf clan that tends the World Tree.

She's so thoughtful that she'll even show you her underwear as a greeting if you tell her it's just a greeting.

However, she has a sense of truth and falsehood, so she will ignore you if you ask too much.

Or, if you cross the line, she'll send her elven assassins after you.


"Ahaha... Is that true...?"

### Erina "Touchy-feely"

She's a brown elf who works as a waitress at the inn they share.

She doesn't have any special powers, but she is often sexually harassed.

Because her skin feels fantastic to the touch.

If you get to know her, she'll occasionally serve you, and she'll probably stay quiet if you touch her a little.


"Oh. Please stop..."

### Anemone "Train Operator"

She's a train conductor witch who runs the train to Walpurgis Night.

She has a laid-back personality and doesn't mind when non-witches get on the train.

She doesn't seem particularly interested in anything in particular and spends most of her time sleeping, except when she's doing her assigned tasks.

If you get to know her well enough, she'll let you play "tricks" on her sleeping body.


"Mmm...? Good morning, huh? What's on my chest? Aahhh... Whatever..."

### Vjora "Passionate"

He is a wonderful young man full of passion and energy.

He is always thinking of ways to protect nature and achieve world peace, and he loves to volunteer with his partner, an artificial intelligence automaton doll.

He may be a vampire, but his willpower has broken the limits of vampires.

His neighbors describe him as a bright young man with good manners.

What's that knife in his hand? Oh, he's cutting grass. Wolverine style.


"WRYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!"

## Companions Herion

Finally, the last choice! This is where you get to decide in advance who you are going to get really close to in the world you are going to.

Once you get to the world of your choice, you'll have the opportunity to become incredibly close to them. Almost soul mates? You'll be so close that you'll be willing to put yourselves in danger for each other.

The harder it is to get to know them, the more points they're worth. And some are really hard to meet. After all, it's hard to get to a girl who lives in the middle of a magma lake that melts with magic, isn't it?

### Nerielle "Elixir"

She is a demon known for her ability to completely heal any injury or illness.

She has extensive knowledge of alchemy, healing, regeneration, medicine, pharmacy, engineering, and mechanics.
Many people desire her for her ability to gain immortality.
She has a gentle nature and likes to be taken care of.

"Hey~ Open your mouth, the plane is arriving~ Huh? You're an adult, so I don't need to do that? But aren't you enjoying it~?"

### Shiroremelion "Conceptual God"

She is a powerful conceptualist who can spin entire solar systems into particles with a flick of her hand. Even in the Age of Fantasy, powers of her caliber were rare.

Raised in this era, she is immersed in all the new forms of entertainment and culture.

Despite her laid-back voice and mannerisms, she has a very fast-paced personality.

"Wow, that's 289 wins in 289 games!"

### Eve "White Witch"

She is a white witch, one of the highest ranking members of the Coven of the Elements.

Not much is known about her true magic, but it is rumored to involve purification.

She is a woman of few words, but she certainly recognizes and appreciates those around her looking out for her.

"..."

### Nephthys "Electronic Elemental"

She is Imperial Intelligence's foremost electronic warfare specialist.

She spends most of her time sitting on a neural link in the Imperial Cimmerian, handling information from across the Empire.

As such, she's a bit of an exhibitionist and a voyeur, but her personality is a bit more reserved.

She's not much of a fighter, but she's got a lot of intelligence.

### Aquieri "Master of the Yonggung Castle"

She's the owner of the resort planet Yonggung.

A planet made of special water that allows you to breathe and see brightly, Yonggung is a huge resort built underwater that brings in tons of tourism revenue every year.

She has an innocent and gentle personality.

"Wow, you did a good job this time, keep up the good work."

### Angolmoa "Transcendent"

She is the commander-in-chief of the Empire's most powerful fleet and the head of the Imperial First Legion.

She holds the most powerful military position under the Emperor, wielding untold power that not even the Emperor would dare to use.

Rumor has it that if she had her way, the universe would have already been unified into a single empire.

"Oh, how cute. I wonder what her face would look like if I poked her?"

### 0-32 "Subject"

She appears to have escaped from a secret laboratory somewhere.

Not much is known about her, but there's no organization looking for her, and no one to blame for creating her.

She doesn't seem to know much about herself either, though she's occasionally spotted on planets with well-preserved natural ecosystems.

"Nice weather."

### Merurun "Hikikomori"

She's a hikikomori demon, and those who envied her nubile body used her race as an excuse to criticize her.

As a result, she spends most of her time in her room, where she has become quite successful as a YouTuber.

### Yuffie "Mesugaki"

She likes to dress slutty and flirt with people and watch them blush with embarrassment.

Maybe it's because she hasn't gotten in trouble yet, but she seems to be getting bolder.

However, she's a powerful telekinetic who can wipe out a city with ease, so I doubt she'll ever get in trouble.

"Hehe~ What's that thing poking out of your pants? Is that your tiny little thing... kyah~! Hahaha!"

### Nea "Senior Analyst"

She's a senior analyst in the Imperial Executive.

She's an incredibly skilled hacker and programmer, having hacked dozens of medium-sized warships in minutes by herself.

She has a playful personality and finds new abilities exciting.

She is so powerful that even a moderate army can't stop her.

"Hehe~. May I analyze that ability?" 

## Goals Euraria

Not sure what to do in the new world?

Maybe just have some fun?

If you're still not sure, here are some of the "events" that are happening in that world right now.

### Runaway Princess

The third princess of the empire is a young girl who longs for adventure.

Lately, she's been running away from her imperial escort and becoming an adventurer.
Recently, she's been thinking about leaving the Empire and visiting a huge dungeon in the Kingdom called the Great Labyrinth.
If you can join her before it's too late, you might be able to have some fun adventures with her.

She grew up in a greenhouse and has no knowledge of sex, so if you ask her to touch her breasts as a greeting, she might be embarrassed and do it. 

Of course, a few days later, she'll blush when she realizes the truth. Its so cute!


### Rescuing the Knight Princess

The invincible Knight Princess of the Kingdom of the Changing has been captured by red ogres!
The ogres want to take their revenge on her, as they have suffered many defeats at her hands. They intend to break her will and train her as a tribal sex slave! She has a strong will, but even she won't be able to withstand the constant humiliation and strange potions, so in time she will turn into a lustful bitch who only craves cocks. One year later, she will beg the ogre leader to take her virginity. They plan to force her to give birth to 100 ogres and then throw her, broken in body and mind, to the slum dwellers.
If you want to rescue her, you'd better do it quickly, or you can wait a few months and use her as a sex slave when she's submissive enough.

### Hollow Island

There are forgotten lands in this world.

A legendary kingdom hidden in ancient ruins and monster forests.

What happened to a kingdom once known for its brilliant mechanical and magical engineering?

If you wish to delve into its secrets, I will give you a compass that will point the way.

There is still someone left in the kingdom, waiting for someone to come.

### Witch in Trouble

Melania, a lone witch living in the mountains, was captured by a mana-eating tentacle during a experiment. While she was unconscious, tentacles drained her of all of her mana so they keep relentlessly rape Melania in her workshop at the top of the mountain, where no one comes to visit. Though her pep does not leave her, her mana-deprived body cannot resist and she is left to cum time after time begging for mercy.
Soon the tentacles will finally subjugate her, turning her into a lecherous slut who will never be the same again. If you act quickly, you can save Melania. Her cunt is so sensitive now that fucking her a few times after rescuing will easily turn her into your willing sex slave. But if you show up too late, you'll find Melania already completely broken and brainless.

### Dungeon City

It's time for adventure!  Why not visit the deepest dungeon in the central continent, the Abyss?

Amazing treasures, gear, money, women, romance and beliefs await you there!

Adventurer guilds, clans, parties and the usual fantasy fun.

From finding kittens to defeating the gatekeeper of the Abyss!

Romantic adventures await you!

Welcome to Dungeon City!

. . . . .

The abyss is always waiting for you.

### Cozy Streets

Lately, this world has been celebrating holidays, and in this world, there is such a thing as Christmas.

The most famous witch in town is organizing an event, so why not participate?

The prize is the right to make a wish for the witch!

Anything too crazy will be denied, but a few days of fun should be fine...?

### Sanctuary of the Guardian

It is said that somewhere on the continent of Evraria there is a secret city in which a warrior's armor is sealed.

According to legend, the descendants of the warrior and his companions built a small city to protect his armor by hiding it in a crystal circle.

Many believe this story is only a legend, but royalty, nobles, and other dignitaries know it to be true.

They secretly send expeditions to find the legendary warrior armor.

Why don't you go in search of it? 

### Sky Island 

A flying castle has recently appeared on the borders of the Empire.

What was it for, who built it, and when?

Perhaps you can unlock its secrets.

If you can conquer it, you'll make your mark on the history books.

### Secret Fairy Garden

There is a legend in the kingdom about the first queen. 
Allegedly, somewhere in the royal palace, she had a secret fairy garden. Everyone thinks it's just a rumor or legend, but the queen's garden really exists.

Why don't you be the first visitor?

You might even meet the ghost of the queen.
By the way, the queen's ghost is real and you can touch it. Apparently, during her lifetime, the queen was known for her beauty.

It was believed that she was a noble and worthy milf, but now there is no knight to protect the forgotten queen... Right?

### Akasha Chronicles

Is there something you want to know? 

Legend has it that there is a library on the continent of Evraria that holds all the knowledge of the world.

If you go there, you might be able to learn about the origins of the world, the secrets of magic, the birth of star technology and life, how to return to Earth - anything you want to know.

From what I hear, it's run by a beautiful young woman.

### Waiting Princess

Apparently, a princess from a dead kingdom is sealed in the basement of some ruins.

If left alone, no one will find her in 10, 100, or more years.

Fortunately, the princess isn't in much trouble, except that she's very lonely, so maybe she can wait a few more decades.

She would be very grateful if you would release her from the seal. It's up to you to decide what to do with a princess who has been trapped for hundreds of years, knowing nothing about the world and having no one to turn to.

For your information, the princess is the "epitome of beauty".

### Continental Party

A continent-wide festival is being held to celebrate the day of Euraria was created.

Once a year, during this festival, everyone on the continent puts aside their wars and quarrels and joins together to celebrate!

Huh? Was Eurasia really created on this day? I don't know...? It would be a spoiler to say, but at least people seem to be enjoying the day!

Who knows, maybe you'll meet someone while enjoying the festivities? Why don't you join in the fun?

### Age of Adventure

Even if it's not a dungeon, there's still a lot of unexplored backcountry in the world.

Not only that, but there are countries that don't even know each other exist.

Why not go and meet new races, new cultures?

### Exploring Ruins

The remains of many ancient civilizations are hidden around the world.
 
Why don't you become one of their explorers?

Discover the demise of an ancient civilization and its secret knowledge!

Who knows, maybe the ancient artifacts you find will turn out to be forbidden knowledge, sealed with ancient weapons, or maybe shards of evil for which the heroes risked their lives...?

To discover, to learn, to explore.

Isn't that the meaning of human existence?

## Goals Magitea

Not sure what to do in the new world?

Maybe just have some fun?

If you're still not sure, here are some of the "events" that are happening in that world right now.

### Walpurgis Night

There's an urban legend in Magitea.

It's said that at one o'clock at night, dusk falls on a dark sky and the platform of a train station in a certain city begins to be crowded with beautiful girls.
It is said that if you board the train with them, you will be transported to a mysterious magical city that is not on the map.
A city of witches in a steampunk era, powered by no science, only true magic. How cool is that?

Who knows, maybe you'll be lucky enough to join a coven of witches?

Or maybe you'll meet a cute witch?

### Lost Technology

The Kingdom of Mayutera's Changeling City has a structure that has been around since long before the Kingdom was founded.

People have always thought of them as just statues or the remains of a palace, but... Did you think so, too?
Those long, white pillars look like powerful weapons, no?
Maybe it's the remains of an ancient city defense weapon? Or perhaps, judging by its majestic proportions, it was a stationary artillery battery meant to annihilate the enemy.

I wonder what the look on the faces of our arcane punk technicians will be when they realize this? I guess it wouldn't hurt to look into it if you're interested.

### Princess Tsundere

The granddaughter of a facsimile duke has a reputation for pampering.
She's got the Duke's golden bloodline, beautiful features, cute soft fox ears, and a fox tail... Wouldn't you like to pet her?
She has an interesting request: if you bring her the Philosopher's Stone, she'll grant you one wish.

For the record, she hasn't set an upper limit on the number of wishes you can make with your wishing rights. How about you give it a try?

So you can ask for just about anything. Like... having her as a pet for three days?

### Gates of Truth

Something strange has happened to an alchemist's guild recently, and bad rumors are circulating.

It's an alchemy guild that specializes in delivering potions and cures to the city, but one day, all of the guild members suddenly disappeared.

The friendly receptionist, the seasoned and friendly guild leader, the hilarious trio of alchemy otaku, the handsome alchemist with a lot of swagger, and so on.

People in town are worried because they've all disappeared overnight.

Will you be able to uncover what happened to the guild and rescue the missing alchemists?

### Milk Machine

Clivel, the chief technical advisor to the Kingdom of Kyonyukyo, has been having a hard time lately.

She's been working on an automated milk machine, but her progress has been slow.

Creating a fully automated machine is no easy feat, even for an Arcane Punk, but she's determined.

She wants to revolutionize farming in the world with her invention.

If you help her, you'll see amazing results. She's even ready to try it on herself!

If you want to win her heart, you should give it a try.

### Peaceful Night

Why not enjoy a rich and cozy city night?

Even if you don't have a goal, you don't have to spend your days fighting wars or making progress.

The world is too beautiful to run with only one goal in mind.

Just enjoy the whispers of the stars, the embrace of a city, the glow of a petal.

Don't you think life is too short to look and enjoy?

The world is not as cold and hard as you think it is.

Maybe it's not a bad idea to listen to the city sing to you tonight.

## Goals Herion

Not sure what to do in the new world?

Maybe just have some fun?

If you're still not sure, here are some of the "events" that are happening in that world right now.

### Interstellar Flight

An intergalactic travel agency "between the stars" has launched its first flight.

Have you ever wanted to visit the planets and stars of the universe?

Planets made entirely of diamonds, giants hotter than the sun, imperial vacation spots, planets where sexy biodroids fulfill unlimited desires, and more.

There's a wide variety of strange and erotic planets waiting for you!

Surprisingly, traveling is free, so if you're interested, join in.

### Cosmic Whales

The sacred sky whales that travel through space are an inspiration to many people.

If you want to experience the mystery and wonder of the universe for yourself, it's not a bad idea to look for them.

They emit waves that heal all diseases and injuries, and are said to be impervious to any weaponry.

They can communicate with humans from a distance with just their thoughts, so it's not a bad idea to befriend them.

### Technician Mistakes

A curious young engineer built a masturbation device and got into trouble.

She created a climax machine that perfectly targets erogenous zones all over the body while fully restraining the user, and then, well, she made the stop button out of reach?
Luckily, the sex machine is equipped with automatic life support system that should keep her safe and alive for about 300 years. So you can go rescue her anytime you want, but if you're too late, you'll find that she's become so sensitive that she can cum at the slightest breeze.

Oh, and she's in a secret laboratory only she knows about, built in the Fifth City of the Empire.

### Battlegrounds

Empires, planetary federations, republics, holy states, machine states, and more.

The many powers of the universe have been spending a lot of energy on the conquest of some areas.

Recently, a battleship crashed in the middle of a civilian planet, causing massive damage.

The citizens of space are growing increasingly angry.

Could you be the one to end the war?

### Abandoned Final Weapon

Many people don't realize it, but the humans of this world were not the first conquerors of the universe.

The legacy of a long-gone civilization still wanders the universe today.

One day, someone will give her a peaceful rest, a new master to rule, or her true love.

She floats aimlessly through space, alone with her thoughts.

But she'll be hard to find unless you're determined to find her, because the last order of an ancient civilization was to hide herself.

### Return of the Gods

It's been a long time since we entered the Space Age.

The ancient gods who once ruled are returning.

But this is a time when humans roamed the stars, conquering planets and building cities.

Can humanity continue to shine before the face of the ancient gods?

Live with the gods or put the gods to sleep again?

It may depend on what you do.

### Space Elevator

Orbital elevators are one of the handiest tools for launching supplies into space.
Well, besides supplies, they're also used to launch simple spacecraft and hard-to-handle junk, but there's been a problem lately. Slightly off-track, the elevator is tilting to the right, and if left unchecked, it will crash within a few years, wreaking havoc on an area nearly half the length of the planet.
The planetary government has no idea what to do with the elevator. The planetary garrison is busy putting down an A.I. rebellion, and the warships are out hunting down hostile space life.
If someone with powerful abilities can stop the elevator from crashing, or at least prevent it from causing an accident, they'll get a big payoff.

### Peace Organizations

It's a space peace organization formed by nations tired of endless war.

With your abilities, you could easily rise to a position of importance here.

You could create true universal peace.

Or shatter it and push it into chaos.

The position of High Chancellor would give you a strong hand in the politics of every power in the universe.

You could reorganize the universe to your liking.

### Machine Rebellion

A few years ago, a number of AI-controlled military units rebelled in unison.
 
No matter where you are or who you belong to, the simultaneous rebellion has thrown many machines out of control.

The machines and A.I.s that managed to take the lead in this rebellion have banded together and declared themselves a nation, with sporadic battles still raging in various parts of the world.
You can help them build a nation, you can stand by and watch, or you can enslave them again.

What will humanity do to cause the AIs to rebel? 

## Endbringer

It seems that one of your chosen abilities has a special destiny!

In the world you're going to, there will be Endbringer near you.

### 

Let me tell you about an urgent breaking news story being broadcast in some other world...

"Breaking news! The Endbringer who was preparing a deadly attack in Brockton Bay has disappeared without a trace..."

## Good luck in the new world!

Are you done choosing?

Good! I hope you don't regret your choice!

Because even though I was attracted to your desperate desire this time and wanted to do something good and help you, it's unlikely that we'll see each other again. 

Although... Uh, I don't know... Maybe I'll have some free time in a few thousand years? It would be amusing to see what you've accomplished! 

Haha! 

Good luck in the new world! And try not to disappear!

## Not enough points?

You have negative points!

That's why we can't apply the choices.

Try to get the points above zero.

How about canceling some selected abilities, or picking more drawbacks?
