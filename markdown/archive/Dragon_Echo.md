## Dragon Echo


No one could have predicted or foreseen it. On a fateful day, the very fabric of your world twisted and warped as hundreds of monstrous rifts tore through the sky and earth, unleashing a horde of enormous, brutal, and powerful dragons. Thousands of fierce and nearly-invincible beasts emerged, like creatures from ancient, dark legends. Each was more dangerous than an entire army, and as if that weren't enough, each wielded its own unique magic. Masters of the elements, of light, darkness, death, life, time and space.

Mankind stood no chance against them. Not only did the dragons burn cities to the ground, their arrival brought with it a magic that quickly changed the world. Technology failed, secret bunkers and laboratories sprouted tentacles and turned into dungeons, people turned into monsters, and the dead rose from their graves. Civilization crumbled to dust, but humanity refused to simply surrender. In the madness of war, every means was used; entire countries were obliterated by nuclear fire before you realized that the dragons were basking in that fire.
 

##  

 You were one of those madmen who refused to surrender and die without a fight. You knew the burning city would be your grave, but you charged the enemy, who roared under the barrage of artillery fire and brought down circling fighter jets with precise bursts of dragonfire. You saw how tank shells bounced off the creature's tough scales, how easily it incinerated all who dared fire at it. You knew you had only one chance, so you put all your faith in the ancient legends.

Steel, explosives, fire - all were useless against the dragons, so you didn't bother with a useless assault rifle. Instead, you stormed into the burning museum. The jade spear of an ancient emperor - just what you needed! Amid the deafening roar of the cannons, you crept up to the beast, which was clearly enjoying the battle, and like a berserker of legend, you charged, knowing that you would die in a minute.

One, just one, strike with the spear that pierced the tough scales, and you were drenched in fiery, hot, poisonous blood as the dragon roared, obviously feeling pain! The huge creature had no intention of dying from such a little thing, but you were able to read the respect in the monster's gaze and smirk back. You were the only one who managed to wound it! A moment later, a massive clawed paw slammed you into the wall, burying you in the rubble of the skyscraper for ages.

![NEXT]()

## Buried

You were sure you were dead. Your bones were crushed to dust, your muscles torn apart, hundreds of tons of concrete, glass and steel had become your tomb, and the poisonous blood of the great dragon ate through your flesh like acid... Your mangled body simply could not have remained alive.

But...

Even though your pitiful mortal flesh had given up, ready to accept death, the blood of the great dragon was so filled with energy that it clung to life even now. Mixing with the remains of your corpse, it forced your torn heart to beat again, nourishing it with pure mana. The dragon's blood seeped in, penetrating not only your body, but even your soul, anchoring it to this world. It twisted you, rebuilt you over and over again, melting the stone and steel that surrounded you to create a new, stronger, more perfect body.
 

## Scales



## 



### No Scales

 Just regular human skin. Soft, delicate and insanely vulnerable. It would be easier for you to pretend to be human, but you'd always feel vulnerable and naked, knowing that you'd once given up a great defense. 

![No Scales](images/R7C1.avif)

### Minimum

Your most vulnerable areas will be covered by dragon scales. It's not much, no more than 15 percent, but it's enough to keep you from forgetting who you are. You can choose whether the scales adorn your face or not. 

![Minimum](images/R7C2.avif)

### Partial

Half of your body will be covered in beautiful and reliable natural armor. There will be no hiding it, but hey, who said you should hide or conceal anything? Let the people hide from you instead!

![Partial](images/R7C3.avif)

### Body

Scales will cover almost your entire body like a dense, flexible, and light armor. You won't even notice it! The key is to choose a good design and color scheme, as it won't be easy to change it!

![Body](images/R7C4.avif)

### Max Protection

 Like a true little dragon, you will be entirely encased in scales. Only your face and other sensitive areas may be covered by scales that shift aside to avoid restricting your activity.

![Max Protection](images/R7C5.avif)

## 



### Sharp

Your scales will have particularly sharp and pointed edges, like tiny spikes. Now it won't be so easy to spank your butt, but you can temporarily flatten the spikes so that you can still be embraced.

![Sharp](images/R8C1.avif)

### Leaves

Each scale on your skin will resemble a tiny green leaf, complete with delicate veins, and the old scales will turn a golden hue before falling off. It seems they can even absorb sunlight, giving you energy!

![Leaves](images/R8C2.avif)

### Plush

Instead of the majority of your hard scales, you'll have soft, fluffy, and warm fur that will be incredibly pleasant to stroke. However, the most important areas can still be protected by scales, ensuring a perfect balance of comfort and defense.

![Plush](images/R8C3.avif)

### Plumage

Your skin will be adorned with small, delicate feathers, much like those of a bird. Hey, there's nothing strange about that - feathers are scales, just a bit softer and lighter!

![Plumage](images/R8C4.avif)

### Crystal

Your scales will be composed of strong, semi-transparent crystals. While they may be a bit more fragile, they look absolutely cosmic and significantly enhance your sensitivity to magic by concentrating mana.  

![Crystal](images/R8C5.avif)

### Silky

Your scales will be just a few millimeters long and will overlap tightly, much like those of a small snake. They can even be mistaken for skin and are incredibly pleasant to the touch.

![Silky](images/R8C6.avif)

### Plated

You will be covered with large, somewhat flexible plates. These plates are stronger than ordinary scales, but the skin at their joints will be particularly sensitive and vulnerable.

![Plated](images/R8C7.avif)

### Bulletproof

Your scales are nearly as strong as those of an adult dragon. Hardened steel can't leave a mark on them, and even a diamond barely scratches the surface. This is likely the best armor you'll find in the new world

![Bulletproof](images/R8C8.avif)

### Needles

You will be able to grow especially long scales that bristle like dangerous needles. You will have full control over them and can even make them brittle at will, ensuring that the broken tips remain in the opponent's wound.

![Needles](images/R8C9.avif)

### Chameleon

Your scales will be able to change color, allowing you to blend in and become less noticeable. Or, you can decorate yourself for a celebration with bright patterns and even 'draw' a graph like on a whiteboard, making your appearance as versatile as it is stunning.

![Chameleon](images/R8C10.avif)

## 



### Crystal Boost

You will be able to embed natural crystals into your scales to significantly increase your magical reserve. Suitable gemstones are rare and fragile, but each one will add 10 percent to your mana reserve.

![Crystal Boost](images/R9C1.avif)

### Hide

With an effort of will, you will be able to hide your scales... Probably under your skin? For several hours a day, they will be completely invisible, and you have excellent control over this, allowing you to choose specific areas and make the scales look almost like clothing

![Hide](images/R9C2.avif)

### Custom

You can choose several types of scales to create your unique pattern or simply cover vulnerable areas with strong armor, leaving your belly soft and sensitive. This allows you to balance protection and comfort in a way that suits you best.

![Custom](images/R9C3.webp)

### Renewal

Every three months, you will shed your old scales and grow new, shiny ones. During this time, you will be particularly sensitive, and the process itself will be quite intimate, so you will hide from everyone. 

![Renewal](images/R9C4.avif)

### Armor Set

Two hours after shedding, your scales will harden, turning into reliable armor. This way, you can create the strongest armor that you can sell or wear yourself, so everyone around will think that your horns and natural scales are just parts of a strange set.

![Armor Set](images/R9C5.avif)

## Wings



## 



### Bare Backed

You won't have any wings at all. No big deal, that's also normal! At least you can comfort yourself with that while dragons look at your bare back with contempt. Damn, for them, it's almost worse than your human blood!

![Bare Backed](images/R11C1.avif)

### Cute

Small and incredibly cute wings. They are easy to hide under clothes, but to fly, you will need to flap them very frequently, which will look very funny and you will get tired much faster than usual. But hey, at least you'll be adorable while doing it!

![Cute](images/R11C2.avif)

### Proportional

Worthy and proportionate wings for a human. Large enough to fly properly in the air or cover your head from the rain. Don't forget, they are incredibly sensitive, so you will purr like a cat if they are stroked.

![Proportional](images/R11C3.avif)

### Majestic

Large and extremely convenient wings for flying. With them, you can majestically soar through the air for days or wrap yourself in them like a cloak. Moreover, if they are strong and sturdy enough, such wings are much more convenient in battle!

![Majestic](images/R11C4.avif)

### Giant

Enormous, overwhelming wings that are much larger than your body. With them, you can accelerate even faster than the speed of sound to launch a swift attack or escape from danger, and all the bonuses from the wings will be doubled.

![Giant](images/R11C5.avif)

## 



### Fairy

Of course, the brightest wings belong to fairy dragons! Thin and elegant like those of a butterfly, they are adorned with the most incredible patterns. They also provide a bonus to illusions and allow you to hypnotize people with their enchanting patterns.

![Fairy](images/R12C1.avif)

### Feathers

Your wings will be made of light and flexible feathers, perfectly adapted for flight. They look especially beautiful if made bright and colorful, adding a vibrant and eye-catching touch to your aerial adventures.

![Feathers](images/R12C2.avif)

### Leathery

Classic leathery wings that help most dragons soar. Strong enough, light enough—they represent the perfect balance, offering both durability and agility in the skies.

![Leathery](images/R12C3.avif)

### Scaly

However, bare skin is too vulnerable, so it's a great idea to reinforce the wings with strong scales! This will make them much stronger! Although it will make them heavier, hey, you're not planning to run away from battle, right?

![Scaly](images/R12C4.avif)

### Fiery

Only a complete fusion with the fire element allows dragons to use flames as wings! You can create them at any moment, but be careful, as wild fire is always eager to burn everything to the ground! 

![Fiery](images/R12C5.avif)

## 



### Wyvern

You will simply have a pair of strong, reliable, and sturdy wings! Why would you even need hands? You can just incinerate your enemies with your fiery breath or use magic if you need to grab something, right?

![Wyvern](images/R13C1.avif)

### Digitigrade

On the bend of your wings, you will have familiar human fingers. Well... Almost. In any case, you will be able to do human things like writing and picking your nose when your wings are folded.

![Digitigrade](images/R13C2.avif)

### Winged Arms

Oh, only fingers aren't enough? Okay, don't worry, you will have a pair of almost normal hands, just with a pair of wings growing from around the elbows! Very convenient, right?

![Winged Arms](images/R13C3.avif)

### Dual

Ugh, fine, even if the dragon blood resists your attempts to keep your hands, it looks like you managed to overcome it and create a pair of normal hands in addition to your wings! Although now your wings also have fingers...

![Dual](images/R13C4.avif)

### Extra Limbs

Oh, is something wrong? With an effort of will, you separated the fingers and... now you have a pair of fully functional wings without fingers and a pair of dexterous human hands... And another pair of hands...

![Extra Limbs](images/R13C5.avif)

### Standard

Phew, it was not easy to overcome the will of the dragon blood, but now you simply have a pair of wings and a pair of hands. There probably isn't a standard configuration for dragon-girls, but this is exactly how you imagine half-dragons.

![Standard](images/R13C6.avif)

### Butt Wings

However, a couple of small and cute wings will not only allow you to better control your flight, but also perfectly accentuate your soft ass... Hmm... Strange, why did you even think about that? However, yeah, it's cute...

![Butt Wings](images/R13C7.avif)

### Adaptable

Your majestic wings will adapt to your pathetic human form, so that when you land, they will shrink so as not to hinder you while you walk on two legs. 

![Adaptable](images/R13C8.avif)

### Fine Control

Dragon wings are better than human hands in every way, and you can control them with unimaginable precision. Not only will you be able to bend them at will, but you'll even prefer to clamp a scalpel on them for an important operation!

![Fine Control](images/R13C9.avif)

### Camouflage

Your wings will passively maintain a simple illusion, so while you are not flying, people will perceive them as strange and elegant clothing or something like that.

![Camouflage](images/R13C10.avif)

### Vulnerable

The membranes of your wings will be delicate and vulnerable. Hey, it's just a few millimeters of skin, so of course, you should protect them and not let enemies injure them! These wings require care and attention to keep them safe.

![Vulnerable](images/R13C11.avif)

### Durable Flyers

Huh, hell, they're dragon wings, not pathetic human flesh! They'll be as strong as your whole body, so any fall that doesn't break your bones won't leave a mark on them!

![Durable Flyers](images/R13C12.avif)

### Shield

...ugh, it looks like the dragon blood is more than willing to infuse them with strength, so they'll be even stronger than your body. So much so that you can use your wings as a shield to ward off enemy attacks!

![Shield](images/R13C13.avif)

### Battle-Ready

Your wings are perfectly adapted for combat, so you can use them as a weapon without hesitation! Their sharp edges can easily cut through steel, and their speed will allow you to instinctively fend off bullets or arrows!

![Battle-Ready](images/R13C14.avif)

### Immature

Ugh... Damn, dragon wings require an insane amount of energy! Fortunately, you can create just a template that can grow later... When you have sex with 1000 different men to use their energy...

![Immature](images/R13C15.avif)

## Tail



## 



### Basic Butt-Slapper

A classic tail. This is an absolute must-have, so don't even think about going without it! And you're not a pathetic lizard to throw it away in case of danger! Plus, it's perfect for slapping your own butt when you're bored.

![Basic Butt-Slapper](images/R15C1.avif)

### Chunky

A thick, short tail that easily holds all your power! After all, energy needs to be stored somewhere, right? And the tail is perfect for that! It might look a bit chunky, though...

![Chunky](images/R15C2.avif)

### Whip-Like

A beautiful, long, and strong tail that can easily knock down any offender like a whip! You didn't think dragons just wag their tails like dogs, did you?

![Whip-Like](images/R15C3.avif)

### Extra-Long

This tail is just a couple of times longer than your body, so you can even stand on it if you want to peek over a fence! Or wrap it tightly around someone to keep them from escaping!

![Extra-Long](images/R15C4.avif)

### S-snake

With this tail, you can glide across the ground like a snake!  Oh, no, of course you won't become a lamia, your legs will stay where they are! So, um... you can, uh... clap your feet?

![S-snake](images/R15C5.avif)

### Tail-First

Why even bother with legs when you have such an awesome tail? Better take this perk to learn how to hide them so they don't get in the way of your gliding! Oh, well, the tail will shrink when you use your legs...

![Tail-First](images/R15C6.avif)

### Ponytail

Seems like your memories of the "ponytail" hairstyle have confused the power of dragon blood... Well... It's a tail, right? You can wag it and all that? Everything will be fine... Probably...

![Ponytail](images/R15C7.avif)

### Twin Tails

Two tails are definitely better than one! You can playfully slap them in the air or even learn to walk on them like an extra pair of legs! And if one gets bitten off, you'll have a spare!

![Twin Tails](images/R15C8.avif)

### Powerful Swing

You'll master a special tail-strike technique that can easily knock down anyone, even an ogre! Though now you'll always be vigorously wagging your tail to keep those muscles toned...

![Powerful Swing](images/R15C9.avif)

### Butt Attack

You'll consider a tail strike to be your most powerful attack, so whenever you're in danger, you'll always raise it high, ready to strike! And when an enemy gets close, you'll even turn your butt to them!

![Butt Attack](images/R15C10.avif)

### Skirt Lifter

Your willful dragon tail will always clearly signal your excitement to everyone around by lifting your skirt higher. And don't even try to wear pants...

![Skirt Lifter](images/R15C11.avif)

### Shredder

Because these sharp scales will easily tear any clothing you try to cover your beautiful butt with. Even if you try to forge pants out of steel, your tail will shred them to pieces!

![Shredder](images/R15C12.avif)

### Steel Whip

To make your tail a truly formidable weapon, it will grow extra-strong scales, turning it into a steel-spiked whip - beautiful and deadly!

![Steel Whip](images/R15C13.avif)

### Delicate

The underside of your tail will be as sensitive as your private parts. Just... try not to show it, even if someone grabs your tail!

![Delicate](images/R15C14.avif)

### Prove It

Your tail will grow at such an angle that everyone will think it's just a buttlug tail. You can only prove otherwise by dropping your pants and letting them take a good look.

![Prove It](images/R15C15.avif)

### Excited Grip

During your heat or if you get too excited, your tail will grab your partners and forcefully hold them until you come at least ten times. And they better be obedient boys if they don't want it to break their ribs!

![Excited Grip](images/R15C16.avif)

### Agile Tip

The tip of your tail will be quite agile and nimble, but to control it precisely, you'll need to concentrate hard... for the first few hundred years. But at least you'll be able to untie ropes or something like that!

![Agile Tip](images/R15C17.avif)

### Third Arm

You'll be able to control your tail like a third arm without even thinking about it! And considering its strength, length, and agility, it's even better than a hand!

![Third Arm](images/R15C18.avif)

### Tentacle Like

The tip of your tail will be especially flexible and agile, allowing you to bend it in any direction and grasp anything, as if it had no bones at all! It's almost like a tentacle!

![Tentacle Like](images/R15C19.avif)

### Tail Fuck

And a tentacle should be very, very sensitive... Well, of course, you probably won't come just from that, but you can easily fuck someone with your tail and get unforgettable sensations!

![Tail Fuck](images/R15C20.avif)

### Dick Tip

Oh, it seems your dragon blood is ready for some experiments... Or maybe you just don't know true dragons well enough? Either way, the tip of your tail will have a very convenient shape for sex, and now you can even come with its help!

![Dick Tip](images/R15C21.avif)

### Multi-Purpose

Well, no one said the tail is only good for sex with girls... It seems to be a much more versatile thing than you thought, and if you take both options, you can switch them in just a minute!

![Multi-Purpose](images/R15C22.avif)

### Stinger

However, a vagina on your tail probably won't help you in battle... Unless... No, still not... A venomous stinger will be much more reliable. Especially if you learn to control poisons and pheromones!

![Stinger](images/R15C23.avif)

### Fluffy Tail

Or maybe a cute, fluffy brush at the tip of your tail? It's great for tickling someone! Or painting pictures? Sweeping away traces? Playing with cats?

![Fluffy Tail](images/R15C24.avif)

### Torch

Though a pair of fiery torches would probably look more fitting, right? In any case, you can light or extinguish them at any moment, or switch to any other type of tail tip.

![Torch](images/R15C25.avif)

### Spiked Mace

For example, a massive spiked mace that can smash even stone walls and crush your enemies like pitiful bugs!

![Spiked Mace](images/R15C26.avif)

### Magic Focus

If you absorb a magical crystal, you can focus your spells with it like a mage's staff, doubling their destructive power!

![Magic Focus](images/R15C27.avif)

### Shape-Shifting

It seems you can shape the tip of your tail into anything. Like a spear or a sword... You can even easily detach them, getting a deadly weapon made of dragon scales! And a new tip will grow in a week.

![Shape-Shifting](images/R15C28.avif)

### Cellular Control

...Wow. You can form scales at the cellular level, so through meditation, you can create very complex internal structures... even simple mechanisms or magical conductors...

![Cellular Control](images/R15C29.avif)

### Second Head

Okay, you should have realized something was off earlier... Your tail has grown a small head, and it seems to be somewhat intelligent, though not very smart... So now you can cast two spells simultaneously?

![Second Head](images/R15C30.avif)

## Horns



## 



### Teensy

They're so tiny, you could mistake them for extra-large scales! But no, these are genuine dragon horns that can do everything the others can. Size isn't everything, right?

![Teensy](images/R17C1.avif)

### Corals

These elegant and delicate horns aren't meant for battle. Instead, they enhance your senses, allowing you to better feel magic and the wind.

![Corals](images/R17C2.avif)

### Antennas

The more antennae - I mean horns - the higher the sensitivity! They might look a bit strange, but with them, you can even hear the radio, sense radiation, and detect shifts in gravity!

![Antennas](images/R17C3.avif)

### Handy

A pair of sturdy, versatile horns that don't get in the way too much but do everything dragon horns should. You know, sticking up proudly, being handy handles, and ramming enemies...

![Handy](images/R17C4.avif)

### Battle

With these exceptionally sturdy horns, ramming will be much easier! You can pierce enemies, deflect attacks, and smash through the top of doorways without even noticing them.

![Battle](images/R17C5.avif)

### Royal

This beautiful and majestic horn composition will make your head look stunning! It looks much better than any hat or helmet, right? You can even conveniently insert several magical crystals!

![Royal](images/R17C6.avif)

### Living Crown

A special configuration of crystals and spells will make this living crown a true artifact, passively suppressing the will of those around you, spreading an aura of power, and boosting your charisma.

![Living Crown](images/R17C7.avif)

### Burdensome

Huge dragon horns are amazing and will definitely empower you, but your weak human body isn't quite up to the task... Your neck will often ache, and your head will be too heavy for the rest of your body.

![Burdensome](images/R17C8.avif)

### Ethereal

Your horns will be woven from pure mana, with no physical form. You can even make them almost invisible, so people will only notice them out of the corner of their eye.

![Ethereal](images/R17C9.avif)

### Soft

You are still very young, and your horns are still growing, so they will be covered with very soft and sensitive skin. It will be incredibly pleasant to stroke them, and you can even try some naughty things, but fighting with them will be painful.

![Soft](images/R17C10.avif)

### Enchanted

You'll be able to infuse the tips of your horns with simple spells, making their attacks especially devastating. They'll slice through steel, pierce even magical shields, and leave wounds that not even a hydra can heal!

![Enchanted](images/R17C11.avif)

### Spell-Holding

Simple spells? Heck, actually you can hold any spells with your horns! You can even capture enemy spells or set additional rules like automatic triggering when an arrow approaches!

![Spell-Holding](images/R17C12.avif)

### Adorned

Without beautiful decorations on your horns, you feel like you're naked! No, even worse... Like you're covered in dirt and filth for everyone to see! So if you have just one nice piece of cloth left, you'll decorate your horns with it first before even thinking about a loincloth!

![Adorned](images/R17C13.avif)

### Tame

If someone grabs your horns firmly, you immediately become much more obedient. At the very least, you stop struggling and biting, and follow anyone, even into the darkest, most frightening alley.

![Tame](images/R17C14.avif)

### Power-Sharing

Your horns will infuse energy into anyone who holds them. You won't even notice the loss, but it will give a simple human enough vigor for many days! However, it's also incredibly arousing, making it almost impossible for them to resist using you.

![Power-Sharing](images/R17C15.avif)

## Body



## 



### Towering

You'll be gigantic, just like a true dragon should be! Well, within human limits, of course. Maybe two and a half or even three meters tall?

![Towering](images/R19C1.avif)

### Mighty

Around two meters tall. Still a big girl who can look down on many! Uh... Strange, why does she have a... you know?

![Mighty](images/R19C2.avif)

### Charming Size

Oh, never mind! Dragons rarely know moderation, but if you're comfortable with this size, why not? Either way, you'll be super cute!

![Charming Size](images/R19C3.avif)

### Shortstack

...or very convenient to use. A meter or even less, but your butt will still be as round and juicy as ever! Anyone can enjoy playing with you like a doll, and for you, any dick will seem bigger!

![Shortstack](images/R19C4.avif)

### Pocket Mode

Hey! No, no, no! No pocket dragons! This form just can't contain all your energy! Oh, fine... you can transform into this form for 6 hours a week!

![Pocket Mode](images/R19C5.avif)

### Bad Genes

You messed it up! It's definitely because of your human genes! Dragons can't suffer from obesity like regular humans! Anyway, you can only get rid of the fat with an insane amount of sex.

![Bad Genes](images/R19C6.avif)

### Carnivorous

You're a predator, and there's no changing that. Most of your diet should consist of fresh, bloody meat, and you'll prefer a glass of hot blood over any other drink. Yes, human blood will do just fine.

![Carnivorous](images/R19C7.avif)

### Perfect Smile

Your teeth will be almost the same as before, just with slightly larger fangs. Plus, all your teeth will be perfectly healthy, and if they get knocked out, they'll always grow back.

![Perfect Smile](images/R19C8.avif)

### Fangs

Sharp, strong as adamantine fangs, almost like those of the big dragons! They're so sharp that if you decide to eat a piece of meat off a knife, you might just bite off part of the blade!

![Fangs](images/R19C9.avif)

### Maw

Your jaw will take on the optimal shape of a dragon's maw, so you won't have any trouble biting off a huge chunk. Oh, don't worry, like before, you'll never accidentally bite anything, so your tongue and other things are safe!

![Maw](images/R19C10.avif)

### Deep Throat

By the way, about those other things... You'll be damn good at swallowing people! You probably won't swallow them entirely, but your sensitive throat will be ready to take anything, even a cock thicker than your neck!

![Deep Throat](images/R19C11.avif)

### Forked Tongue

Your long, forked tongue will let you sense smells and tastes much better, so much so that dogs will just whimper in envy at how well you track scents.

![Forked Tongue](images/R19C12.avif)

### Luscious Lips

Your lips and tongue will be so sensitive that even during a brutal rape, you'll mainly feel and climax from deep kisses, and oral sex for you will always be amazing.

![Luscious Lips](images/R19C13.avif)

### Scent-Driven

Your sensitivity to smells and human instincts strangely combine... Now male pheromones literally drive you crazy! An alpha male will turn you on you just by standing nearby, and if he puts his cock on your face, you'll only dream of serving him.

![Scent-Driven](images/R19C14.avif)

### Claws

Human nails are a pathetic joke, so of course, you should replace them with sturdy dragon claws! Even the smallest ones will be much more useful!

![Claws](images/R19C15.avif)

### Ripping Talons

But what's the use of small claws? Full-sized claws will make it much easier to tear enemies apart! No armor can withstand them, and they look much better, right?

![Ripping Talons](images/R19C16.avif)

### Gentle Grip

Ah, yes, pathetic human flesh... Don't worry, dragons never hurt accidentally. Your fangs and claws seem to be covered by a soft protective field when you're squeeze your firm breasts or spanking someone's butt.

![Gentle Grip](images/R19C17.avif)

### Superior Paws

Ha, humans! What are these pitiful feet? And you're proud of your bipedalism? Powerful, agile paws will be much better! With them, you can easily run a hundred miles an hour or walk on the ceiling, gripping with your claws!

![Superior Paws](images/R19C18.avif)

### Perfect Thighs

Your hips will become wider and stronger, yet remain soft enough to be the perfect tool for strangling enemies! So much so that many will dream of this pleasure just by seeing them!

![Perfect Thighs](images/R19C19.avif)

### Sweet Spot

Hey, don't think dragons are just brutal creatures focused on efficiency! They also like pretty, cute things! So your sweetest part will be elegantly adorned with soft, delicate scales!

![Sweet Spot](images/R19C20.avif)

### Flexible

Your body will become flexible and agile, and stretching and complex positions will bring you exquisite pleasure, so you'll always be happy to do a vertical split or twist to see your own butt.

![Flexible](images/R19C21.avif)

### Dragon Force

Dragons are strength, ferocity, and all-crushing power! Now you're stronger than a dozen men and can easily throw boulders weighing tons. Huh? No, you don't have to look like a bunch of muscles if you don't want to.

![Dragon Force](images/R19C22.avif)

### Tireless

Fatigue? What are you talking about? What even is that? Pfft, what silly things you humans come up with! Of course, dragons never get tired. Never! Even a half-dragon can go without sleep for a year and fight at full strength for months without stopping!

![Tireless](images/R19C23.avif)

### Modular

Pathetic human! Why hide and sneak around? Just kill all your enemies! Oh... Fine... You can temporarily hide your wings and tail, but it will require portal magic, so it will be expensive.

![Modular](images/R19C24.avif)

### Scaly Style

Do you really need that hair on your head? It's better to replace it with reliable and sturdy scales. See, you can even stretch them... Much better! Looks good, right? 

![Scaly Style](images/R19C25.avif)

### Unique Hue

Due to serious metabolic changes, your skin will change color, so now you definitely won't be mistaken for a pathetic monkey. Hey, you won't waste energy trying to hide this color, right? That would be silly!

![Unique Hue](images/R19C26.avif)

### Obvious Inhumanity

Let's make your features even more pronounced and vivid, like a frightening dark makeup, which will make your non-human nature even more obvious! You can even change the pattern according to your mood!

![Obvious Inhumanity](images/R19C27.avif)

### Glowing Horns

What about glowing, bright patterns? Eyes burning with fury? Beautiful, right? Humans can only dream of such abilities! What? Oh, right... You can use your majestic horns as a  nightlight.

![Glowing Horns](images/R19C28.avif)

### Flaming Head

But if you need a bright torch, there's an even better solution! Your hair will burn with real fire! You can easily control its size, but... huh, until you have fire immunity, this flame won't burn anyone!

![Flaming Head](images/R19C29.avif)

### Bright

Your scales, horns, wings, even your aura - everything will be adorned with extraordinarily vibrant, rich colors! At first, it might seem like random splotches, but there will be an exquisite balance, like a painting by a skilled artist.

![Bright](images/R19C30.avif)

### Small Memento

Hmm? Wait, boobs? Those bags of fat on your chest? What are they even for? Are you storing poison there? Fine, I guess small boobs won't do any harm, you can keep them as a memento of your past.

![Small Memento](images/R19C31.avif)

### Poison Milk

Even bigger? Uh, okay... Dragons don't breastfeed anyone... But these bags of fat can't just be there for nothing, right? At least let them produce a couple of liters of milk a day! Or better yet, poison! You can choose at any time, as well as the taste of the toxin!

![Poison Milk](images/R19C32.avif)

### Mana Tanks

Hmm... You know, they can be useful... This is the perfect place to store extra mana! And the more energy you accumulate, the bigger they'll get! Convenient, right? You can also infuse your milk with energy, just make sure people don't burst into flames after a few sips!

![Mana Tanks](images/R19C33.avif)

### Bouncy Tits

Damn, they're too heavy and will get in your way! However, it only takes a little energy to trick gravity! Now your breasts will be light and will bounce happily with every step, attracting everyone's attention!

![Bouncy Tits](images/R19C34.avif)

### Sensitive Nipples

Ah! Now I understand why these boobs are needed! These nipples! The sensation is amazing! Mmm... Maybe we should make them even more sensitive! And tighter so they can be twisted and bitten as hard as possible while you wriggle out cumming from that sweet pain over and over again!

![Sensitive Nipples](images/R19C35.avif)

## Holes



## 



### Cloaca

And lastly, the classic cloaca. Everyone uses it, and its perfect form has been honed over millions of years, so there's really no need to choose anything else. It's universally sized and can handle any egg.

![Cloaca](images/R21C1.avif)

### Sensitive Pussy

A pussy? What's that? Humans don't have a cloaca, but they have a special hole just for fucking? But... that's genius! So we can make it much more sensitive! Let's see what the maximum is... And now, let's add even more! Ha, don't worry, dragon nerves are stronger than human ones, so you'll handle it!

![Sensitive Pussy](images/R21C2.avif)

### Elastic

Ha! A separate hole is indeed more convenient! So we can make it especially elastic, so even the biggest cock won't tear you apart! You might even be able to handle a real dragon's cock! Well, if you practice a bit, you definitely will! And if you don't forget to take regeneration...

![Elastic](images/R21C3.avif)

### Virgin-Like Grip

Mmm? Oh, right, human cocks are probably tiny... Okay, I think we can make it so that your "pussy" stays virgin-tight even after the biggest dick. You'll be able to squeeze even a straw and milk anyone without moving your hips!

![Virgin-Like Grip](images/R21C4.avif)

### Scaly Cunt

Now, let's cover this excellent cock hole with soft, gentle scales... Hey, you don't want bright human labia standing out against your scaly butt, do you? You pervert!

![Scaly Cunt](images/R21C5.avif)

### Glowing Holes

What, maybe make your holes glow in the dark? So they're sure to get everyone's attention? Hmm... It might even be convenient, though, so no one misses the target...

![Glowing Holes](images/R21C6.avif)

### Pubic Pride

No, dragons don't have any special scales on their pubic area... Damn monkey... Fine, you'll have pubic hair. You can be proud of it and show it off to everyone, telling them about your great victory over dragon blood, about how you preserved your humanity!

![Pubic Pride](images/R21C7.avif)

### Fire Hot

Pfft! But wait, we can make them fiery! And enhance your pussy even more, making it blazing hot so that every cock literally burns with passion! Your lube will protect them from damage, but the sensations will be incredible!

![Fire Hot](images/R21C8.avif)

### Creamy

Dragons are better at everything! So even your lube will be superior! It will enhance sensitivity, heal minor wounds, and allow you to enjoy even spiky cocks and things like rough sticks and battle pins. Oh, and yeah, it will look like cum.

![Creamy](images/R21C9.avif)

### Perfectly Clean

Oh, yuck!  That second hole, why is it so stinky in humans?! Here, just a bit of magic and it will be perfectly clean and also lubed! Waste? What waste, you'll just fully absorb everything you eat, even stones and steel!

![Perfectly Clean](images/R21C10.avif)

### Enhanced Anus

Hmm... And this "anus" is much simpler than a cloaca... Just a sphincter... Hmm... I think we can improve it too! It will become more sensitive like a clit and be able to stretch to take a whole hand! Plus, I'll strengthen the intestines with muscles so they grip the cock along its entire length!

![Enhanced Anus](images/R21C11.avif)

### Ecstatic Pain

Oh, it looks like both your holes are now just for sex... So let's make your anus even stronger and more sensitive, haha! And tweak the nerves a bit, so the harder you get fucked in the ass, the more pleasure you'll feel! This pain will be ecstatic, so you'll always welcome hate sex and surprise anal that makes you scream!

![Ecstatic Pain](images/R21C12.avif)

### Instinctive Relief

Your fuck holes are so pleasant, and your tail fits so well that sometimes you'll instinctively insert it inside to relax a bit. It's as natural as yawning and just as enjoyable! Although it might be a bit awkward if you do it in front of everyone...

![Instinctive Relief](images/R21C13.avif)

### Plugged Night

To avoid these accidents, you should probably just sleep with your tail inside one of your holes! Let it slowly and gently fuck you all night, which will surely help you relax and sleep well! Maybe it will even satisfy it... Probably... Or it might just make it more excited and the tail will plug your holes even more often?

![Plugged Night](images/R21C14.avif)

### Pregnancy Control

No, no, what nonsense, humans can't impregnate you! Only dragons! There's nothing to control here! Ugh... Fine... If you spend a lot of mana, you can charge the sperm enough to impregnate you and produce worthy offspring!

![Pregnancy Control](images/R21C15.avif)

### Crystal Eggs

All your empty eggs will still be infused with mana and turn into beautiful magical crystals. What? Carrying a child inside? For a whole year? Oh no! No womb, what nonsense? Only eggs!

![Crystal Eggs](images/R21C16.avif)

### Fist-Sized

You will lay relatively small eggs, maybe the size of a fist... Or two? Usually, only the youngest and smallest dragons lay small eggs, so maybe even you can lay about five at a time... Every week...

![Fist-Sized](images/R21C17.avif)

### Big One

A worthy size! You will lay eggs much less frequently, only once every three months, and your belly will swell for two days beforehand. Oh, and I hope you've already improved the elasticity of your fuck hole... Or are you a masochist who will just take the regeneration?

![Big One](images/R21C18.avif)

### Mana-Infused

To quickly grow worthy offspring, you can continue to infuse the egg with mana even after laying it. This way, it can continue to develop and grow further! You can truly grow a real dragon if you have enough mana!

![Mana-Infused](images/R21C19.avif)

### Quick Learners

Your children may be born very small, but they will be fully functional right away, able to eat, run, and even fly within a few days! Of course, you'll need to care for them until they grow and teach them various things, but it will be much easier.

![Quick Learners](images/R21C20.avif)

## Dick



## 



### Cute

Wait, wait... why do you need a dick?! You were a guy?! Oh, gods, then why did you have to make a fuck hole? Ugh... Fine... it's silly to waste energy redoing everything, so here, let's make your clitoris a little bigger...

![Cute](images/R23C1.avif)

### Petite

Okay, okay... Not a cute clitoris, but a small penis. Just palm-sized. It actually suits your pitiful, almost human body... What? Humans usually have even smaller ones?

![Petite](images/R23C2.avif)

### Presentable

Well, screw them. Let your penis look at least somewhat decent. Ha, just 15 inches, but it's enough to show off or fuck some tiny hot hole.

![Presentable](images/R23C3.avif)

### Arm-Sized

A penis almost the size of your arm! Ha, it's still tiny by dragon standards, but compared to you, it looks like a decent club! You can even lick the tip if you bend your neck a bit!

![Arm-Sized](images/R23C4.avif)

### Hyper

All right, stop messing around with these little things! Of course you can't always walk around with a proper dick, so just let it simply grow to fully satisfy any partner, even a dragon! And 10 percent more on top of that! 

![Hyper](images/R23C5.avif)

### Constant

Even when it's relaxed, your hose won't shrink in size, just become softer, so you'll always have an impressive piece of appetizing meat swinging between your legs.

![Constant](images/R23C6.avif)

### Sheath

As it should be, when your penis isn't needed, it will hide in its sheath to preserve its superior sensitivity and tenderness. Ha, in your case, even the sheath will be barely noticeable.

![Sheath](images/R23C7.avif)

### Hidden

If you really want to hide your huge penis to appear girl, magic is the best choice! The penis will only appear when you want it to, and the rest of the time, you'll be indistinguishable from a regular female.

![Hidden](images/R23C8.avif)

### Internal Testicles

No, dragons don't need to cool their balls outside, so they can be well-hidden inside the body. It's much safer, and with your additional holes for fucking, they won't get in the way.

![Internal Testicles](images/R23C9.avif)

### Erogenous Balls

Hmm... Fine... Let them be outside... But they should be reinforced with magic... Wow! They're that sensitive?! That's why they're outside?! Well, now they don't feel pain, only pleasure, so squeeze them harder!

![Erogenous Balls](images/R23C10.avif)

### Unstoppable

Once you're horny, your dick won't go anywhere until it's nicely fucked some hole. No, masturbation is not enough! Damned monkeys, dick is for sex, not for fooling around!

![Unstoppable](images/R23C11.avif)

### Plug It

Ugh... What... What have you done? Silly ape! Now your penis will always be hard unless you plug it! Even the magical one needs to be plugged before it disappears, and you'll feel it all the time!

![Plug It](images/R23C12.avif)

### Double Dick

Okay. I mean, what's the difference now? You already have a double set, right? And even more holes than needed... Well, let there be two penises, at least you can fuck both human female holes at the same time...

![Double Dick](images/R23C13.avif)

### Penetrable

A third hole for fucking? Right in the penis? Seriously? Oh, right, you also fuck in the mouth... So that's the fourth? No! We're definitely not going back to the nipples to make them fuckable too! Pervert!

![Penetrable](images/R23C14.avif)

### Ovipositor

Umm... Your brain is definitely hopelessly damaged.... Why would you even lay eggs in someone? Who besides a dragon can nourish them with the necessary amount of energy? Fine... whatever... Just feed them properly before you shove them into someone.

![Ovipositor](images/R23C15.avif)

### Scaly

Yeah, there you go, a regular hard cock with nice soft scales for extra stimulation. Although unaccustomed to this, human females will probably cum like crazy with every thrust from the hyperstimulation...

![Scaly](images/R23C16.avif)

### Knot

Here! A knot is a great idea, so the female can't escape until you've filled her with sperm! Just make sure she doesn't tear! And try not to forget about it when you're fucking their throats. I mean, they need to breathe, right?

![Knot](images/R23C17.avif)

### Hentai Field

Well, dragons are full of perverts, too, so... So, actually, you can fuck anyone and any way you want. Even if your cock is three times the size of your victim's, the magic will make sure she doesn't die, though it can still hurt... if you want it to. 

![Hentai Field](images/R23C18.avif)

### Dick Support

Oh, it seems the penis is too big for your small body, so it can only be hard when you have something inside! Well, it's silly to waste mana fixing this, so just plug your hole with something.

![Dick Support](images/R23C19.avif)

### Piercing Desire

A regular penis isn't enough for you, so you'll have an irresistible desire to decorate it with piercings to get new sensations. The holes will heal incredibly fast, so each time you'll have to painfully pierce them again.

![Piercing Desire](images/R23C20.avif)

### Messy

You'll cum an extremely huge load, so you can easily bloat a regular girl's belly, feed her full, or flood her face, breasts, and tummy with cum.

![Messy](images/R23C21.avif)

### Delicious Elixir

Dragon semen is much tastier than human ones! It is full of energy and will give strength to anyone! It can even heal the wounds of a dying man! Ha, for humans it is a real elixir of eternal youth and health, but it must be swallowed while it is still hot!

![Delicious Elixir](images/R23C22.avif)

### Addictive

Ha, actually, your sperm is so packed with energy and so delicious that ordinary people can get addicted to it like a drug! Just a dozen doses and they'll be ready to do anything just to get you to fuck their throats again!

![Addictive](images/R23C23.avif)

### Corrupting

Wow! This is even stronger than it seemed at first! Or are you all secret perverts? In any case, your cum will corrupt anyone who drinks it, freeing them, awakening their hidden kinks, so you can easily turn anyone into a crazy, cock-hungry slut!

![Corrupting](images/R23C24.avif)

### Endless Loads

Forget it, the refractory period is just a result of human weakness. And dragons can come again and again as long as they have mana. Ha, I think even you can easily feed a whole army of succubi!

![Endless Loads](images/R23C25.avif)

### NEXT



![NEXT]()

##   


Undoubtedly, you were dead. 

And that made the resurrection all the more agonizing. Buried beneath heavy rubble of ruins, you writhed in torment. An ordinary human would have been doomed to die again, and your human half thrashed in panic, unable to fathom the cruel joke of your resurrection. How could one breathe the dense stone dust under meters of earth? 

A human would have been doomed, but your new, mighty body had other plans. With inhuman strength and perseverance, silently roaring in blind fury, it was ready to challenge the very fabric of existence. Inch by inch, powerful paws pushed aside the immovable stones. It seemed an eternity had passed before you shoved away the final boulder, and your hand broke through to the surface. 

A heavy breath, as if the first in a millennium, pierced your chest with pain, and you coughed, intoxicated by the fresh air. Emerging outside, squinting in the bright sunlight, you spent several minutes relearning how to breathe and see, trying to remember who you were and whose voice was echoing in your head.
 

##  

 
Battle, rage, dragon, blood, spear, agony, death. 
 Dragon. 
You are a dragon.
No, you're... human. You fought against it!
But man couldn't survive...
And yet... Your talons... A sinuous tail?

Blinking away the lingering haze, you surveyed your surroundings with newfound clarity. Lush greenery, towering trees, barely recognizable remnants of ancient ruins. It must not have been your imagination – truly, an eternity had passed since that fateful battle in which you died as a human.

The once-grand city lay in ruins, abandoned for centuries. Did you lose back then? Had humanity fallen?

Hah. Somehow, that thought didn't even seem important to you. Around you was a whole world full of life and birdsong. You were certain you would find someone...

After all, you were ravenously hungry.

##

![NEXT]()

## New World

Take 14 or more

## 



### Bitten Moon

One of the first things you noticed in this new world was the huge moon in the sky. A massive freakin' moon with visible traces of giant claws and fangs, as if something tried to take a bite out of it!

![Bitten Moon](images/R29C1.avif)

### Lava Fields

You vividly remembered your last battle in your previous life. The burning city, flowing lava... Surprisingly, even after hundreds of years, the dragon's flame continued to rage! The planet seems to be covered in fiery fields for thousands of years to come.

![Lava Fields](images/R29C2.avif)

### Changing Rain

The world is so saturated with alien magic that ordinary storms often cause spontaneous mutations, create illusions, or anomalies. Luckily, wild magic is unstable, and all of this disappears within a few hours or days.

![Changing Rain](images/R29C3.avif)

### Desert Treasures

People fled the cities during the cataclysm and never returned, fearing that dragons now consider it their prize. Most things simply rotted and turned to dust, but in dry deserts, you can find almost untouched ruins.

![Desert Treasures](images/R29C4.avif)

### Mysterious Past

You found a lot of weird ancient stuff. Did your world have steam-powered giant plastoceramic robots? Or did you just forget something over the centuries? And did anyone build buildings out of crystal?

![Mysterious Past](images/R29C5.avif)

### Cursed Labs

You heard earlier that something terrible was happening with the underground bases, but you definitely didn't expect it to still be going on! They've turned into perverted dungeons with monsters, traps, and precious treasures from the past! Some even still have lights on!

![Cursed Labs](images/R29C6.avif)

### Underground

When you first saw it, you couldn't believe it for a long time - entire cities had sunk underground due to magic! And what's more terrifying - it seems someone lives here, so you preferred to leave this mystery unsolved, not daring to descend into the gloomy depths.

![Underground](images/R29C7.avif)

### Dragon's Dream

The very existence of dragons changes this world, distorting its laws, lands... Or are they deliberately changing some lands to create a familiar landscape for themselves? Hah... in your opinion, some valleys now look exactly like they're from another planet.

![Dragon's Dream](images/R29C8.avif)

### Legendary Sculptor

Legends say that some dragons liked classic human architecture so much that they endowed a great architect with unimaginable power. The immortal mighty creator still creates masterpieces all over the world, and you'll definitely encounter them more than once in your adventures.

![Legendary Sculptor](images/R29C9.avif)

### Peaceful Lands

Although not immediately, you still managed to find ordinary, peaceful, and populated lands. It's even surprising how rich this land is - due to magic, they harvest a dozen crops a year, so no wars or cataclysms can cause famine, and people here are much stronger and healthier than in the past.

![Peaceful Lands](images/R29C10.avif)

### Playground

During the war, you only saw great dragons, but now humans mostly encounter young and mischievous ones. They rarely burn cities, and even if a traveler wanders into their lands by mistake, the dragon won't kill them right away. Instead, they'll enjoy a fun chase, giving the victim a head start and a chance to escape... or enjoy them in other ways...

![Playground](images/R29C11.avif)

### Cursed Lands

Many lands are still saturated with terrible curses, but people have long gotten used to them and treat them as something natural. So if a curse causes terrible pain when someone covers their crotch, everyone undresses without hesitation. Or they wear a buttplug... or spank each other's butts... or bite nipples. It's almost like applying sunscreen!

![Cursed Lands](images/R29C12.avif)

### Damn Horny

Humans are very lucky that deadly curses have long since spent their energy, and only naughty ones remain, right? Or someone regularly updates them... In any case, arousal curses are so widespread that everyone considers it normal and is surprised if the slightest hint of sex doesn't turn them on or if they don't masturbate 5 times a day. Just slap a girl's butt and she'll get wet in anticipation!

![Damn Horny](images/R29C13.avif)

### Hentai Rule

However, even curses can be useful! It protects victims of violent abuse perfectly! They even enjoy it! And the more violently they're abused, the more their holes are stretched, the more they're beaten and humiliated - the more pleasure they feel, and their bodies don't even get damaged! Well... Though after this, many become desperate masochists dreaming of being sex toys for monsters...

![Hentai Rule](images/R29C14.avif)

### Sex Drug

In fact, curses make sex so enjoyable that it's damn easy to become addicted to it. Those endorphins, those happy hormones! Especially since people only become healthier and more beautiful because of the curse, so it's incredibly hard to resist fucking all day long! And once you rape someone a dozen times in a row, they'll be begging you to continue!

![Sex Drug](images/R29C15.avif)

### Superiority

Dragon's pheromones are so strong they drive people completely nuts. Even in your past life, you heard stories about folks dropping their weapons and rushing to please dragons as soon as they caught sight of their majestic dick. Since then, things have only gotten wilder... And everyone who's survived this humiliation will remember it as the best hours of their life!

![Superiority](images/R29C16.avif)

### Swords and Guns

Sure, not much of civilization remains and people live in some villages, but the new world hasn't lost its ancient tech. Humans love killing and fighting so much that they'll never give up their beloved guns! Revolvers, rifles, machine guns - all this stuff helps people survive in a world of monsters and magic! Bang-bang! Too bad ammo's so darn expensive...

![Swords and Guns](images/R29C17.avif)

### Dragon Steel

You're not the only one who noticed that dragon fire is practically unquenchable... Humans figured this out long ago and learned to mine dragon steel from the ruins - iron that's always red-hot but still stays damn sharp! It's tricky to work with, but it makes for excellent fiery blades that can even fuel spells with their heat.

![Dragon Steel](images/R29C18.avif)

### Fire Battery

Damn, looks like humans really can adapt to anything! Dragon steel? It's a perfect, albeit insanely expensive, energy source! So people learned to create engines that can run for years without a break! And then you just toss out the worn-out engine and pop the fiery battery into a new one!

![Fire Battery](images/R29C19.avif)

### Sailboats

Seems like magic didn't just make the world more fun and diverse - some laws of physics clearly work a bit differently now. No, seriously, you bet it wasn't possible to travel over land so easily with sails before!  Otherwise, why did people in ancient times even bother with horses and carts?

![Sailboats](images/R29C20.avif)

### Steampunk

Some city-states managed to bring back tech. You were sure dragons would torch any big city... But it seems the local dragon pack likes shiny airships. So they often circle around, playing and demanding meat as tribute... And with surprising foresight, they burn specific factories that get too techy.

![Steampunk](images/R29C21.avif)

### Relics

Even centuries later, you can still find high-tech relics from the past. They're crazy expensive, but everyone's so used to finding working phones, force field generators, or auto-medkits in ruins and labs that you're the only one who thinks it's weird. You mean, didn't phones used to break after just a couple years?

![Relics](images/R29C22.avif)

### Alchemy

Humans didn't just keep their chemistry books, they figured out new magical herbs and minerals too. So you can get the best potions and meds here! Any wandering trader sells healing potions for just a few coins! Or fun drugs... or aphrodisiacs... Or dick-growing potions... Gender-swapping? Damn, why are there so many naughty potions?

![Alchemy](images/R29C23.avif)

### TentaMagic

You never doubted humans! Of course, they mastered magic! Sure, it's the simplest, crudest way of summoning otherworldly beings who cast spells for a price, but still! Anyone can learn it! Though it's usually hot girls who do it, 'cause it's easier for them to "pay" their partners... And those old wizards? Oof, people don't hate and fear them for nothing...

![TentaMagic](images/R29C24.avif)

### Twice as Nice

For some reason, this world has tons of twins. Like, every four or fifth pregnancy is twins, usually super cute and close sisters who love doing everything together. Plus, twins always share partners, so don't be surprised if someone who looks just like your girlfriend hops into your bed. After all, you're already familiar with that body, right?

![Twice as Nice](images/R29C25.avif)

### Size Matters

With all these new races, weird mutations and quirks, girls always straight-up tell you the max size they can take. Just sit down at a cafe with a stranger, and she'll honestly say her butt can handle 21 inches, and her pussy 28. It's just politeness, because you never know which guy's packing a monster, or which halfling's eager to take one.

![Size Matters](images/R29C26.avif)

### Oops, My Bad

Society always has its unwritten rules. And one here is that if a girl bends over in the wrong place, forgets her panties, or gets too drunk - it's her own fault if she gets a dick up her butt! And if it's already in, she should let the guy properly use her hole. Taking too long is still considered rude, and everyone treats it like a silly prank. It's even amazing how often they forget their panties...

![Oops, My Bad](images/R29C27.avif)

### Winner's Right

After winning a fight, it's totally normal to fuck the loser. Maybe more than once. Maybe even have fun with friends raping the victim for a week, or give them to your dogs. The winner can do anything, because they're stronger! If the victim behaves, they're let go after the fun's over, so girls usually accept their fate without even thinking of biting.

![Winner's Right](images/R29C28.avif)

### Breeding

Some monsters can only breed with human females... It's pretty weird, but... actually, other monsters can knock up girls too and always a monster will be born. So, girls have it tough! The only bright side is monsters never kill them, so there's always a chance of rescue or escape after a couple of births. Hey, it's just a month! Or two?

![Breeding](images/R29C29.avif)

### Sick Days

Monster rape is so common that people stopped worrying about it and treat it almost like catching a cold. Nobody's shy about it, and saying you couldn't make a meeting 'cause goblins caught you is normal. It's not even considered cheating, so sometimes girls use it to cover up affairs! Though they do have to actually visit the monsters for that...

![Sick Days](images/R29C30.avif)

### Feats

Sexual feats and oddities are valued almost as much as other interesting stories, so you often hear girls in bars bragging about how many guys or monsters fucked them at once or how huge a dick they could take. Hah, spending a month as a seedbed will be remembered for years, with everyone happy to listen to the story and buy drinks for it!

![Feats](images/R29C31.avif)

### Quests

The quest system here is super developed, with tons of wanderers and mercenaries doing nothing but random errands. Monster hunting, resource gathering, basement rat extermination, or even temp work as a bar maid - you can find anything on the quest board! And if you offer a good price, mercs will gladly do whatever, even clean your room and tell you a bedtime story!

![Quests](images/R29C32.avif)

### Adventurer's Guilds

Mercenaries have long organized into clans and guilds that vouch for their service quality. They even have emergency rescue teams, their own healers, and even pensions! If a job's accepted, a big guild will do anything to finish it, even dealing with unexpected problems! But... Ugh, why do all these guilds look like dens of dangerously skilled mercs, tricksters, and criminals?

![Adventurer's Guilds](images/R29C33.avif)

### Adventurers

You can meet anyone among adventurers. Even goblins or monster girls. Even just monsters! For some reason, everyone treats them like a separate adventurous race, and they act differently too, like characters in some game. A goblin adventurer might be a genius mage and even treat their green-skinned relatives like savages, saying it's high time to burn all the lairs.

![Adventurers](images/R29C34.avif)

### Secret Buff

It's actually a secret, but you just had to be nearby to catch that special scent... Yeah, all adventurers regularly "challenge" young dragons. But of course, this fight is like special foreplay, since both they and the dragons know it'll end in rough, fun sex. After all, it's dragon sperm that gives adventurers their tirelessness, strength, energy, smarts, and special abilities!

![Secret Buff](images/R29C35.avif)

### Noble Blood

Aristocracy in this world has truly special abilities, and their unearthly beauty sets them apart from ordinary people. Delicate pale skin that's hard to pierce even with a knife, sharp minds, longevity, and agility - you even thought they were a separate race like vampires, but no, they're just regular humans who sometimes marry heroes or beauties. And to leave no doubt about their nobility, they never cover their bodies, rightfully proud of their perfect forms!

![Noble Blood](images/R29C36.avif)

### Princess Fate

You had no doubt. Dragons. Princesses. Delicate noble pussies, whose virginity isn't meant for a husband, but for a monster's huge cock that'll make them scream like bitches. Almost every noble girl spends a few years in dragon lands when she's "kidnapped". Those who haven't been raped senseless hundreds of times in a row, filled with cum again and again, are considered second-rate brides, as their children won't get the noble dragon power, only weakening the ancient lineage.

![Princess Fate](images/R29C37.avif)

### Cursed Loot Gamble

Dungeons have surprisingly many cursed items! It's unknown where monsters get or why they even keep human equipment... But everyone knows that the cursed, perverted items are the most powerful! They often give very useful effects, and one in ten thousand pieces can grant its owner incredible abilities and strength! So when someone finds tentacle armor panties, a gag, handcuffs, or something like that, they put them on right away! Even if you can't take it off for a month, it's your best chance to get stronger!

![Cursed Loot Gamble](images/R29C38.avif)

### Dragonbane Armor

Surprisingly, dragonslayer armor is so common it's almost worthless. Great fire protection, strongest steel to guard against crushing... They even give endless stamina and increase the owner's dick tenfold! But in exchange, the guy becomes so insanely aroused he can't think of anything but fucking, and no one can withstand his rage and huge cock... except dragons. Wait, do these perverts hide this armor themselves to avoid accidentally crushing their partners?

![Dragonbane Armor](images/R29C39.avif)

### Captive

When you saw the captive dragon, you couldn't believe it, watching as mere mortals teased, humiliated, and even raped her with huge, tree-sized dildos. How could humans do this? Why isn't her pack saving her? How can chains even hold an adult dragon?! Oh... No, they can't... Scaring off the humans with a roar, she easily broke the chains and flew away, and people immediately rushed to fix the equipment for the next session, complaining that it's actually hard work... Turns out it's a damn masochistic dragon who has fun like this every week, and the residents are obliged to humiliate her and come up with new games!

![Captive](images/R29C40.avif)

## New Races

Take 7 or more

## 



### Elves

When you first saw these long-eared ladies, you thought elves had invaded along with the dragons. I mean, if one fairy tale could crash into your world, why not another? But nope, turns out it's just a fun little mutation. It gives them beauty, long life, and cute little wings that keep their tops off.

![Elves](images/R31C1.avif)

### Nekos

The cat girls turned out even cuter than you expected! For some reason, there are no boys among them, but that doesn't bother them at all. And they behave just like cats: purring when petted, wagging their tails, catching mice... Heck, you can even find a couple of strays and take them home! Just don't forget to feed and play with them!

![Nekos](images/R31C2.avif)

### Kitsunes

When you saw these gorgeous red foxes, you froze in shock. They're... they're so fluffy! Sure, you have scales now, you're almost a dragon, but you still bit your lip in envy, thinking that you could have been reborn as a fox! Uh... maybe? They're just... ah, never mind, they're just so cute! And judging by the magic flowing through them, this isn't some mutation, but an ancient race!

![Kitsunes](images/R31C3.avif)

### Lamias

No, no, she wasn't bitten on the butt by a snake! It's just... well, you're not sure how it was even possible, but legends say this tail is payment to an ancient goddess who saved people hiding in the deserts. Though others say it's just another dragon curse... And rightly so! After all, it's super fun to tug on a lamia's tail!

![Lamias](images/R31C4.avif)

### Chamelias

A whole group of people managed to adapt perfectly to the transformation curses, so now they can freely change their own form. It's tough and takes a lot of energy, but for a couple of hours a day, they can pretend to be someone else. People say that the most fun starts when they get drunk and stop controlling themselves!

![Chamelias](images/R31C5.avif)

### Succubi

As soon as you saw these horned sluts, you knew they were your natural rivals! Beautiful, brave, smart, with their own natural magic! Hell, they even have horns, wings, and a tail like you! You couldn't care less about the souls of mere mortals, but their very existence feels like a challenge to you! And you won't back down! You'll show them that you're better at... everything!

![Succubi](images/R31C6.avif)

### Futa Demons

Um... At first, you thought succubi with dicks should be called incubi or something... But they quickly told you that those tender, sensitive wimps didn't even show up in this world, preferring to charm ladies at resorts instead of fun hunting! So these gals decided to have fun on their own! Huh? Can they really hop between worlds, not just appear from hell?

![Futa Demons](images/R31C7.avif)

### Horny Slaves

As soon as anyone defeats a succubus, she immediately declares herself the winner's eternal sex slave. In fact, it seems they even prefer living in collars and worshipping their owner's hard cock, ready to please them day after day... Until they master run out of energy and kick them out. But there are plenty of other "masters" around, right?

![Horny Slaves](images/R31C8.avif)

### Free Maids

These girls are obviously seriously cursed. And judging by the smell, definitely not by dragons... Swift tentacles, unbelievable strength, immortality, and absolute submissiveness and willingness to serve anyone. No one knows where they come from, but sometimes you can find one standing around in a cave or something. As soon as they see a human, they'll beg to be allowed to serve.

![Free Maids](images/R31C9.avif)

### Pixies

Small, cheerful and mischievous little flies. They're pretty useless, barely able to talk, but it's still nice to see them frolicking among the flowers from time to time. Many people feed them special honey candies, while others complain that pixies have stolen their jewelry. Damn, they're not even as flexible as they could be... Maybe you should curse them?

![Pixies](images/R31C10.avif)

### Wasps

Ugh... Looks like not all insects are harmless! These wasps are so fierce and dangerous that nobody even tries to resist wild swarms during mating season. They just drop and present their butts! But the wasps are smart enough to live among humans and fly away to the mountains when they feel their heat coming on. They also make excellent mercenaries, ready to die for the hive's profit.

![Wasps](images/R31C11.avif)

### Mimics

Many mimics got tired of hiding, so now they just live among humans as a regular sentient race. They still love to hide and pretend, but usually take on a special "mimic-girl" form. They say it took nearly 100 years to choose and debate this design! But hey, at least they picked something truly cute! They don't like changing form for no reason, but happily do so in brothels where they usually feed...

![Mimics](images/R31C12.avif)

### Goblins

Small, green, cursed with endless lust, and crazy about anal sex. Especially with someone big. Very big and very strong! That's really all you need to know about goblins. They're so sex-obsessed that they offer their butts to everyone, always and everywhere. So if you meet a goblin, be sure that within five minutes you'll see her anus, already lubed and ready to take anything.

![Goblins](images/R31C13.avif)

### Orcs

Or trolls. Or super mutants. Hobgoblins? Anyway, they're big, green, and dumb enough to believe they can beat anyone with their bare hands. Usually, they actually can, so if you dramatically throw away your weapon, they'll do the same and rush in to catch you and rape you long and hard with the whole tribe. They're incredibly fertile and even try to impregnate guys!

![Orcs](images/R31C14.avif)

### Phantoms

They're not invisible, no, they're... as if they don't exist at all. Like they live in some parallel world, only occasionally appearing in reflections or leaving barely noticeable traces. There are very few of them, and many think the phantoms are just children's fairy tales. However, if you're lucky enough to catch the attention of one, you can even communicate by leaving messages on glass or something like that.

![Phantoms](images/R31C15.avif)

### Fawnfolks

Cute and utterly defenseless deer-girls living in forests like savages. They have only two legs, but incredibly soft booties. They're natural prey, and literally anyone can catch them with a bit of effort. Fawnfolks can't fight at all, so their only defense is... Well, you can see for yourself.

![Fawnfolks](images/R31C16.avif)

### Cervidians

Four legs means four times the speed! Uh... Strange, why not twice? Anyway, these does are excellent runners, so they have way more free time. That's why they're much less wild, even quite serious and smart! Maybe just because it's damn inconvenient for them to masturbate, so they don't waste time on that either.

![Cervidians](images/R31C17.avif)

### Centaurs

Oh, centaurs! The fastest runners, but they're strong, brave, and horny enough to chase rather than run away. They also have some difficulties with masturbation, but with their strength, it's not their problem anymore... In cities, they behave calmly and even work as taxis, but it's better not to meet them in the steppes, or you'll end up riding tied under them.

![Centaurs](images/R31C18.avif)

### Witches

Sorceresses, witches, experts in ancient lore and artifacts. They can change their appearance, so they always look like damn sexy babes. People often call them sluts for summoned monsters and... usually that's how they pay for their services, so most witches are nymphomaniacs. By the way, if you see a witch wearing panties - you can be sure they're cursed!

![Witches](images/R31C19.avif)

### Half-Dragons

They're almost like you! Oh... No, wait... They may have wings and be slightly stronger than normal humans, but these half-breeds didn't absorb the blood of a great dragon like you, they were just born as a result of the fun of young dragons. You know, the birds and the bees... But they all have unique abilities and appearances, so you can't get bored with them!

![Half-Dragons](images/R31C20.avif)

## New Monsters

Take 7 or more

## 



### Psycho Plague

You don't know for sure if it's a brain parasite, a curse, or evil spirits, but this thing turns ordinary people into unimaginably dangerous, cruel, and smart psychopaths who can use weapons and tactics. They're especially numerous in some ruins, and once they reach a populated city, a real nightmare begins - because as soon as you kill one of these monsters, someone nearby gets possessed.

![Psycho Plague](images/R33C1.avif)

### Shelterers

Surprisingly, people are still hiding in secret bunkers! But they think the whole world is a radioactive wasteland full of mutants and savages... Actually you could rescue them and bring them to other humans... but these descendants of big shots act like absolute jerks who shoot at everyone, thinking they're monsters, so nobody even thinks about helping them.

![Shelterers](images/R33C2.avif)

### Underworld

Okay, maybe the sheltered folks have some reasons to fear everything and everyone. After all, truly scary, evil creatures inhabit the cursed underworld... Ugh, they might have been human once, but now they're definitely monsters! What? No, of course, nobody talks to them! Just look at these freaks, you should burn them as soon as you see them!

![Underworld](images/R33C3.avif)

### Bone Golems

Nobody's afraid of regular human skeletons anymore or even considers them proper monsters - any peasant with a pitchfork can beat them. But bone golems are a whole different story! They come in the most unexpected shapes, making them much harder to fight, plus their magical core is much stronger, so they can reassemble themselves again and again.

![Bone Golems](images/R33C4.avif)

### Pokemons

All sorts of small, funny monsters. Nobody even bothers to give them separate names because they constantly mutate and chaotically mate with each other, so one litter can have completely different creatures. However, they're almost always smart enough - about as clever as a very intelligent dog, so people often train them and keep them at home. Some even collect them!

![Pokemons](images/R33C5.avif)

### Hypnoplants

This liana really wanted to join the monster list, but no matter how much it mutated, it couldn't become fast enough... So it attracts its victims with pheromones and drugs! Captivity with them is incredibly pleasant and tempting, and since the lianas themselves fuck too slowly, the plant usually makes its victims rape each other. So it's better to come with friends!

![Hypnoplants](images/R33C6.avif)

### Cthulhus

Cunning, stealthy creatures! Nobody even knows how many there are or where they live, because they completely brainwash their victims, and even if they escape, they think someone else raped them! And if a girl disappears... Well... There are actually many other monsters here... People also say that sometimes cthulhu's victims are lured in and catch new victims by leading their former friends to the creatures' lair.

![Cthulhus](images/R33C7.avif)

### Werewolfs

Mean, with prickly fur, always smelling of wet dog. Oh, yes, right - very strong and dangerous, especially during mating season. Their dick is unusually large, and their sperm and pheromones are addictive, so after losing to them a few times, you won't be able to resist them anymore and will become their free-use bitch. Keep in mind that there are usually at least a dozen males in a pack, and they're all very enduring!

![Werewolfs](images/R33C8.avif)

### Wrigglers

Hm? Strange, why do all other monsters have quite ordinary names, but tentacles got their own name? Fleshy, long, slimy, love to penetrate deep into all holes at once... Well, yeah, these are just regular tentacles! Mm? Oh, that's it! They say that when their offspring grow up, they writhe inside the victim until she returns to the wrigglers, because only they can take them out! ...and immediately lay new eggs, so you'll have to come back again in a couple of months...

![Wrigglers](images/R33C9.avif)

### Triceratops

Legends say that when dragons found bones in museums, they decided they were their relatives and resurrected them. Well... Apparently, it was someone very young, or just wanted to joke. Anyway, now several species of ancient and dangerous reptiles roam the earth. Some people even use them as armored battle mounts, but horses are actually much faster.

![Triceratops](images/R33C10.avif)

### Kobolds

These scaly ones were created as obedient minions to serve dragons. They clean their caves, build towers for kidnapped princesses, mine gold, steal gold from humans in raids, trade gold for grown wheat, set up banks to steal even more gold from humans, and ideally take everything and make people pay with useless paper... Oh yes, you have enough dragon blood, so you can use them as your slaves too, if they're not serving someone else.

![Kobolds](images/R33C11.avif)

### Dragonlings

Small, funny monsters that mimic dragons. Of course, they don't have that great power, but usually people avoid hurting them for fear of angering someone bigger... Which these cheeky creatures often take advantage of by stealing food and banging girls. No, seriously, how can they be mistaken for dragons? Or are these just perverts who dream of something great but want to practice first on safe little cocks?

![Dragonlings](images/R33C12.avif)

### Cosplayers

Oh, more half-dragons? Hey! These are goblins, aren't they? They're just wearing fake horns and butt-plug tails! Even this scale is just a costume! Damn cosplayers! What are they even hoping for? That someone will be scared of them? Oh, judging by the fact that they don't even try to cover their tender parts and the mischievous gleam in their eyes, the reason is quite different... Damn perverts!

![Cosplayers](images/R33C13.avif)

### Fans

Many who have tried true pleasure from a dragon's dick dream of it for the rest of their lives, and nothing else can satisfy them. Some simply rightfully consider dragons the superior race, while others even worship them like gods. In any case, you're like a living demigod to them, whom they're ready to give themselves to as soon as you beckon. Surprisingly, it seems there are far more of your fans among the nobility...

![Fans](images/R33C14.avif)

### Dragon Hunters

These are the strongest, most desperate, craziest mercenaries that... no, of course they're not crazy enough to challenge a real dragon! All who tried that were eaten long ago! These guys hunt half-bloods to capture and sell them at a high price! To alchemists, rare collectors, sultans, perverts, brothels... Or anyone who offers a handful of coins for an hour of unforgettable sex!

![Dragon Hunters](images/R33C15.avif)

### Cultist

These nuns clearly worship the wrong gods... But what's even worse - their slimy deities answer them... They tell them secrets, teach them, help them deceive mortals and gain power, so they can bring even more sacrifices in their glory, so they can spill even more blood, accumulate even more energy and...

![Cultist](images/R33C16.avif)

### Emissaries of Chaos

...summon their emissaries, who will drown the world in blood and pus, cover it with putrid curses, tear it to shreds preparing this sweet dish for their masters. These creatures can grow into nightmarish titans, but dragons hate them and burn them while they're still small. Any mortal will receive tons of gold for just reporting these creatures.

![Emissaries of Chaos](images/R33C17.avif)

### Cyber Witches

Witches again? Aren't they... Damn, are they pretending to be monsters in the wild lands? Or... it seems these are a bit different from regular summoners. The color of their aura is slightly different, and these glowing eyes... Isn't that a cyber-implant? Or is it a magical artifact? Oh! ...and looks like they're excellent at running away and hiding to conceal their secrets and where they get ancient artifacts from.

![Cyber Witches](images/R33C18.avif)

### Necrons

There aren't many necrons left now, as they were cursed in ancient times with this strange immortality. No, they're not mindless aggressive zombies! They've fully retained their sanity and don't need the blood of the living! Well... Truth is, most of them lost their minds long ago and now usually engage in some crazy nonsense out of boredom... And an army of rubber ducks isn't even the worst option.

![Necrons](images/R33C19.avif)

### The Emperor

One of the greatest heroes who even managed to use the curse to his advantage. Over hundreds of years, he developed the greatest psionic gift, conquered an entire empire, subduing people and monsters, but... One day he got bored of everything. So much so that he just sits on his golden throne not even interested in what happened to his empire. He's like a maxed-out character that's no longer being played.

![The Emperor](images/R33C20.avif)

In its own way, this world was quite nice.
Plenty of fresh air, tasty and nutritious food that you often had to hunt... Even the enemies seemed to be part of it, and fighting with them only fanned the flames in your heart! 
Rage, fights, hunts, adventures!
It was so intoxicating that it took you a while to realize that you were acting like a wild beast. A monster that eagerly devoured fresh meat, slept under bushes, and growled instead of cursed. You didn't even have proper clothes...

Sure, your new tough body was thriving in this life, but your human half was desperate to give in to the tempting call of the wild! No, you would not become a monster! You would live as a human!

All you had to do was choose one of the cities where people lived and settle down! Charming cafes, lots of socializing - that's just what you needed to keep from forgetting what human speech even sounds like!

Well... perhaps people wouldn't be thrilled to see another dangerous monster girl around, but you were sure you could handle it! Everything would be fine; you just needed to find a new home!

## Mistressia

Take 7 or more

## 



### Amazonian

In this city, the girls are insanely strong and tough! Seems like any girl who lives here for a few years becomes a head taller than most guys and can easily beat them with bare hands, as if they have some kind of attack bonus against men!

![Amazonian](images/R40C1.avif)

### Good Boys

Guys? Well, it looks like the boys here have to be damn obedient if they don't want their butts spanked. They simply have no choice, and most of them literally wear collars as a symbol of belonging to their Mistress.

![Good Boys](images/R40C2.avif)

### Pets

Men are often walked naked on leashes like pets here. What? You think someone lets them get used to it and passersby don't pay attention? Ha! Of course not! They're constantly teased, mocked, and humiliated, so they're almost in tears every time!

![Pets](images/R40C3.avif)

### Tight Leash

Bad boys need to be kept in line, so their leashes are usually attached not to comfortable collars, but directly to piercings in their dicks. Some are literally held by the balls! So if the mistress gets angry and tugs the leash a little harder, they'll know true pain!

![Tight Leash](images/R40C4.avif)

### Dollified

Of course, local men aren't allowed to behave like proud alpha males! That would be ridiculous! Mommies know best what's good for them, so boys are often dressed in girly clothes, forced to wear high heels, makeup, and vibrators!

![Dollified](images/R40C5.avif)

### Boob Brawl

Power and strength in this city are determined by breast quality, and girls often settle their disputes by rubbing boobs to see whose are bigger, whose nipples are more sensitive and tender, whose milk tastes better, and which boob shape is superior.

![Boob Brawl](images/R40C6.avif)

### Snu-Snu Safari

Amazons often raid neighboring lands to catch more boys. No, they don't force them with weapons! They just sexually dominate the guys, raping them one by one until they surrender and follow their new mistresses!

![Snu-Snu Safari](images/R40C7.avif)

### Caged Harem

And it looks like they're very good at it because there are so damn many guys here! Each Mistress has at least half a dozen slaves she plays with every day! Well... Of course, sometimes she might not have time, and they'll have to wait in cages.

![Caged Harem](images/R40C8.avif)

### Free for All

Boys who live in this city but don't have a mistress for some reason attract special attention from all women. Of course, they're not considered slaves, they're completely free! Free for public use!

![Free for All](images/R40C9.avif)

### Bigger is Better

Of course such strong and big girls could not do with small and pathetic dicks, so they long ago found a way to enlarge any penis to a suitable size! True, for the guy, this means several weeks of continuous torture without a single orgasm...

![Bigger is Better](images/R40C10.avif)

### Living Furniture

Ha, looks like these ladies know how to live! At least in this city, there are damn comfortable chairs! Oh, don't worry, all Mistresses are very generous and allow you to use their furniture, so you can use any free seat!

![Living Furniture](images/R40C11.avif)

### Chastity Champions

There's a belief that it's very harmful for guys to cum, so the most beloved slaves are always kept in chastity cages. It's for their own good! This way, they'll be much healthier and stronger! True, with all the curses of this world, it quickly turns into torture...

![Chastity Champions](images/R40C12.avif)

### Milked

On the other hand, if abstinence is so painful... Maybe it's better to help guys get rid of excess sperm? Some girls do just that, milking their favorites dry several times a day, ignoring their moans and complaints.

![Milked](images/R40C13.avif)

### Pegging

Having sex with guys? Oh, taking their members in the pussy? Ugh... That's only for reproduction! The rest of the time, local girls fuck guys themselves with huge, spiked strap-ons! And their pussies are only for gentle, loving tongues and babies!

![Pegging](images/R40C14.avif)

### Brutal Love

Often even huge strap-ons can't express all the love and care of a Mistress for her slaves, so they often invite futa monster girls over to fuck their beloved slaves as brutally as possible! They're even willing to pay for it if you have an especially big dick!

![Brutal Love](images/R40C15.avif)

### Last Man Standing

Playing alone with your slaves is fun, but it's much better to have fun in company, right? So many Mistresses often have fun forcing guys to fuck each other while they tease and humiliate them! And the slave who gives up first gets a special punishment at home!

![Last Man Standing](images/R40C16.avif)

### Bull Milk Dairy

Everyone knows that sperm contains many useful vitamins and energy. Look, succubi and some other monsters only feed on it and feel great! So the Mistresses have organized whole farms for the production of male milk!

![Bull Milk Dairy](images/R40C17.avif)

### Blue Balls Winery

Sperm is like wine - the longer it's aged, the tastier it is! So some guys are kept on the very edge of orgasm for weeks, continuously stimulated but not allowed to spill a single drop of seed. They say once a rich succubus ordered sperm with three years of aging...

![Blue Balls Winery](images/R40C18.avif)

### Orgasm Control

Mistresses have long learned all the weak points of guys and have mastered the art of oral. They can completely control male orgasms, making them cum every few seconds or making them beg for a release for days!

![Orgasm Control](images/R40C19.avif)

### Censored

Beta guys have no need to stare at the intimate and tender parts of their mistresses, so slaves are often taken to witches to curse them with censored perception! Most guys after this start to love their mistress's feet or hands much more!

![Censored](images/R40C20.avif)

### Manliest Males

In this region, you'll find the toughest, most determined dudes around. These muscular, dominant studs are ready to pound any hole and make any bitch submit. The chicks from Mistressia call them renegades and rapists, but... isn't it just natural for a strong man to take what he wants?

![Manliest Males](images/R42C1.avif)

### Big Boys

For some reason, all the men here not only have gorgeous, athletic physiques like Greek gods, but they're also packing some seriously massive meat! We're talking about truly enormous schlongs! They even have a special aura, so no matter how experienced you are, you'll feel totally stuffed by them!

![Big Boys](images/R42C2.avif)

### Nudist Law

All the girls in town are required to strut around completely naked, hiding nothing. Usually, the weather's great, so it's pretty convenient, but you can bet everyone will be constantly ogling you. And by law, you can't even close your legs!

![Nudist Law](images/R42C3.avif)

### Red Hot

Many girls here walk around with red handprints on their butts, and you can hear spanking sounds everywhere. And they don't even wash the cum off their skin? Are they just lazy? Are they perverts who enjoy the feeling? Or is that forbidden too? Either way, it's better to do the same...

![Red Hot](images/R42C4.avif)

### Public Property

Female buttholes are considered public property here, and no girl can refuse anal sex. Usually, no one even asks - they just start pounding away. Though, the girls can keep going about their business without getting distracted by it.

![Public Property](images/R42C5.avif)

### Buddy Bangs

The local guys aren't jealous at all and often share their bitches with friends. After all, what brings friends closer together than double penetration, right? Or triple... Or... Well, they'll first gang-bang one chick before moving on to the next!

![Buddy Bangs](images/R42C6.avif)

### Good Girls

Everyone knows that a good girl's ass should often be red from slaps. After all, how else do you train a proper wife or slave?  This is such a common belief that girls even ask for it themselves if they're not punished at least a little throughout the day.

![Good Girls](images/R42C7.avif)

### Motorized

Actually, punishing a bunch of sluts can be pretty tiring, and your hand starts to hurt... So they invented a special machine here! Now they just tie up bad girls for a couple of hours and enjoy their screams and pleas for mercy!

![Motorized](images/R42C8.avif)

### Facial

Looks like you're especially popular here. They even passed a special law saying you have to obediently take facials from anyone who wants to give you one! You can make angry faces, but in the end, you have to gently kiss the tip and lick up the leftover cum.

![Facial](images/R42C9.avif)

### Blowjob its a Job

Everyone knows bitches don't know shit, can't do anything, and are only good for fucking. So the only job available for girls in this town is being a whore! And a pretty cheap one at that, since there's a ton of competition! Everyone's ready to offer up their holes for just a few coins!

![Blowjob its a Job](images/R42C10.avif)

### Domestic Maids

Uh... Well... yeah... Someone's gotta clean up... So there's also maid work! Cooking for the master, cleaning the house after orgies, taking his dick whenever he wants... And most importantly - wearing a cute maid outfit!

![Domestic Maids](images/R42C11.avif)

### Decorations

Seriously, is there any other way to use these sluts? They're just fuck meat! Hmm... Beautiful fuck meat! So they're often used here as moaning, lust-filled living decorations.

![Decorations](images/R42C12.avif)

### Living Statues

The city streets need decorating too, so they often tie up slaves, naughty girls, or random whores as living statues. Don't worry, they've got good vibrators, so they're not bored!

![Living Statues](images/R42C13.avif)

### Caged Pets

And they often keep beautiful but disobedient girls as pets. Collar, leash, cage, and the occasional treat of the master's dick. Usually, they're not even allowed to talk and are walked with the dogs, letting them play together.

![Caged Pets](images/R42C14.avif)

### Nourishing Sluts

And... hmm... turns out there are quite a few uses for these bitches, hah! Anyway, to maintain the local hentai fields, they need to feed one creature in the city dungeons... They usually leave bitches there for a week.

![Nourishing Sluts](images/R42C15.avif)

### Branded Fuckmeat

In this town, they absolutely love decorating girls with the most humiliating writing, and guys often compete at it. The bitches don't want to be covered in boring phrases either, so they suggest interesting ones themselves!

![Branded Fuckmeat](images/R42C16.avif)

### Hardcore

The guys here are incredibly strong and brutal, so the roughest, most violent sex is common! If a bitch isn't screaming in pain - she's either being choked or her throat is stuffed with a thick cock! Hah, but the local chicks are tough as nails and even enjoy it.

![Hardcore](images/R42C17.avif)

### Love of the Brute

Guys love seeing the marks of their inhuman love, so the fuck meat is often covered in bruises and scrapes. You should be bruised too! And if you're too tough - just draw them on, you dumb whore!

![Love of the Brute](images/R42C18.avif)

### Its a Trap

There are some guys in town who, envying the bitches, gave up their masculinity. Real men hate them, humiliate them, and fuck them five times harder and more often, force them to wear permanent chastity cages, even let bitches rape them and fist them! But for some reason, there are more and more traps...

![Its a Trap](images/R42C19.avif)

### Public Goblins

When the town decided to punish sluts with public rape and set up stockades, even more goblins started coming to town! They steal everything they can, and then happily run to the guards at the stockades, demanding to be punished as soon as possible!

![Public Goblins](images/R42C20.avif)

### Queen of Lust

Huh? What's got you so surprised? Yeah, the city ruler is a high succubus. Who else could set up such a sweet life for the guys, eh? Not only does she let them ravish her 8 days a week, guzzling sperm, but she also collects horny energy from the whole city, making her wickedly powerful.

![Queen of Lust](images/R42C21.avif)

### Hunting

Men love hunting and often have fun outside the city. Of course, they take all their pets along so they don't get bored at home! So if you see a girl chasing a rabbit on all fours, and then getting pounded by a pack of hunting dogs - don't worry, it's just a regular hunt.

![Hunting](images/R42C22.avif)

### Sweet Poison

Despite all the humiliation, the local girls are damn happy, and even when offered refuge in Mistressia, they refuse! Just one week here and a girl will prefer serving her master's cock to any other life! Hmm... The water tastes a bit strange... Drugs? Unlikely they'd affect you... that quickly.

![Sweet Poison](images/R42C23.avif)

### Obedience Charms

You can buy obedience medallions in pretty much every shop here. Just five coins and any girl becomes crazy obedient and horny! There are even sneaky versions that don't glow and look like cute pendants! Or ones that can swap rape memories for nice chats about the weather!

![Obedience Charms](images/R42C24.avif)

### Bitch Farm

There's no such thing as too many bitches, they just sometimes take up too much space and need too much care. So in Lordshold, they keep 'em in special farms. It's a bit cramped, but they've got all they need! They even get banged at least 5 times a day so they don't get bored! Though usually by animals and monsters...

![Bitch Farm](images/R42C25.avif)

## Wild Lands

Take 7 or more

## 



### Raids

Life in the Wild Lands is dangerous and hard as hell! It's survival of the fittest, and with so many strong monsters and well-prepared human raids, a newbie like you is definitely in danger. Remember, these people have been fighting monsters for hundreds of years!

![Raids](images/R44C1.avif)

### Equal Opportunity

Boy, girl, futanari, or even more exotic forms... The Wild Lands have absolute equality for all genders! They'll bang anyone with even the slightest hole to stick a dick in! Some monsters can even create one themselves, altering your body!

![Equal Opportunity](images/R44C2.avif)

### Preferred Hole

They don't care where they fuck you, but they still respect your opinion here, so if you don't like them using a particular hole for sex, just tape it or stuff it with a plug! They'll just use the other holes even more enthusiastically!

![Preferred Hole](images/R44C3.avif)

### Brutal Bliss

The strongest lewd curses are here, so everyone gets much more aroused and enjoys sex much more. Especially rough and brutal sex. There doesn't seem to be any rape here, as every bitch violated by monsters climaxes like never before and demands more!

![Brutal Bliss](images/R44C4.avif)

### Age of Consent

They may be monsters, but even they don't mess with kids! ...However, a month before a girl reaches the age of consent, a bunch of monsters start following her around. As soon as she becomes an adult, they catch her and throw her first crazy gangbang party! They even bring gifts and booze!

![Age of Consent](images/R44C5.avif)

### Food Source

Your cum is incredibly nutritious, so hungry succubi will constantly pester you to feed them. It's better to make deals in the Wild Lands than to make new enemies, as these bitches can take revenge and cause a lot of trouble if you don't let them suck you off daily.

![Food Source](images/R44C6.avif)

### Human Shield

Orcs can also cause a lot of trouble or even burn down your house... But their chiefs have a tradition of using living shields in war. If you agree to be one, the orc tribes will leave your home alone and even trade with you. Don't worry, their petty wars have no enemies that can actually hurt you, so just enjoy the ride!

![Human Shield](images/R44C7.avif)

### Exorcism

When the Inquisition arrives to fight demons, succubi from all over gather for this festival! The holy fathers desperately try to exorcise the evil spirits by torturing their bodies for days. You've got horns and a tail too, so they'll try to "cure" you too! Oh, and there's free booze and snacks, lots of guests and bards to make it even more fun.

![Exorcism](images/R44C8.avif)

### Guard Dogs

It's hard to be alone in the Wild Lands, because you could be attacked while sleeping! Luckily, there are demon hounds ready to protect any bitch! They help many here and guard sleep well... they just require a small fee. Many get so used to it that they can't even fall asleep without a good knot in their pussy and the feeling of hot cum inside!

![Guard Dogs](images/R44C9.avif)

### Parasites

It's just inevitable. You can boil water, wash your hands, clean all the dicks, and use condoms, but eventually you'll find tentacles coming out of your ass. Fortunately, they don't harm their hosts, and even improve digestion, so nobody worries about it. You just have to "give birth" to a couple of tentacles sometimes!

![Parasites](images/R44C10.avif)

### Daily Tentaclings

The Wild Lands is full of traps, wild tentaclings, and other weird monsters that hide well and ambush people to fuck them. They're damn quick, and it's really hard not to get a tentacle up your ass at least a couple times a day here! But everyone gets used to it quickly and doesn't pay much attention - usually they cum in just 5 minutes, and then it's easy to break free.

![Daily Tentaclings](images/R44C11.avif)

### Bargains

There's a very easy way to make deals with many of the monsters in the Wild Lands - just give birth to some of their offspring, and as long as you smell like a good, obedient bitch, they won't bother you. It's especially easy with egg layers. Just a few days as a voluntary incubator and the tentaclings won't touch you for a few months!

![Bargains](images/R44C12.avif)

### Arachnids

Of course, if you have to carry kids for every type of monster in turn, you won't have much free time left... Although many do just that... But you can cheat! You just need to give in to a strong monster! Like arachnids! The stronger they are, the bigger their eggs, and the fewer other creatures will want to mess with you, fearing to offend your partner!

![Arachnids](images/R44C13.avif)

### Dragon's Pet

Dragons are miles above the top of the food chain! Even the smallest and youngest ones that sometimes play in the Wild Lands! Submissively offer them your cunt, and while you're carrying their eggs, monsters will not only be afraid to offend you, but will even take care of you for fear of the dragon's wrath! Ask for water, and even a werewolf will rush to the spring to fill your flask!

![Dragon's Pet](images/R44C14.avif)

### Healing Chamber

Mimics take good care of their victims, wanting to enjoy them as long as possible. So much so that they even heal their wounds and rejuvenate them! And give them a bunch of happy drugs! So many people come to them voluntarily, because in a couple of days they can restore even a lost limb! The main thing is that someone has to get you out afterwards, otherwise you might spend thousands of years here in endless ecstasy!

![Healing Chamber](images/R44C15.avif)

### Fast Travel

The wild lands are huge, and there's no one to build bridges across rivers and canyons... Luckily, there are very convenient giant wasps that allow you to travel hundreds of kilometers quickly! They're incredibly fast, and any flight will take only an hour! ...most of which they'll spend filling the client with their eggs.


![Fast Travel](images/R44C16.avif)

### Metamorphosis

Some monsters can modify their victims' bodies. Usually they just add a few more holes for fucking, but they can turn your limbs into something really weird, making it damn hard to escape. Usually these transformations are temporary and disappear after a month. Or not. Then you have to go back and do it all over again!

![Metamorphosis](images/R44C17.avif)

### Starfish Bra

These starfish really love breast milk and suck boobs with furious power, increasing milk production tenfold and making nipples super-sensitive. Plus, if you wear them for more than a week, they allow you to "breathe" underwater, so many girls wear these starfish to search for treasures in sunken cities and just enjoy the depths of the sea.

![Starfish Bra](images/R44C18.avif)

### Wombhunter

If you want to get rid of the annoying attention of particularly strong monsters that will continuously hunt for your ass, but don't want to regularly carry their children, you'll have to find new victims for them and bring girls to them! Oh, it's not so bad! You can just pay, and many whores will do it voluntarily!

![Wombhunter](images/R44C19.avif)

### Order of the Clitorites

These nuns tirelessly rescue random girls every day who have fallen into the clutches of the most horrific monsters! If you're in sexual slavery and can't escape, they're your only hope! Oh no, they're not great warriors at all. They just replace the victims with themselves, voluntarily giving themselves to the monsters! Hah, the best monsters have whole lines of these holy nymphomaniacs!

![Order of the Clitorites](images/R44C20.avif)

### Your Home



![Your Home](images/R45C1.avif)

### Discriminations



![Discriminations](images/R45C2.avif)

## Your Home



## 



### Tavern

You'll be living in a regular room at a tavern. It's cramped, and random travelers will often pinch your butt, and drunken guests might even burst into your room, mistaking it for their own. But hey, it's dirt cheap! Plus, the kitchen's not bad, there's a comfy shower, and no bedbugs in sight, so it's not all bad!

![Tavern](images/R47C1.avif)

### Sweet Home

You've got a small but cozy cottage built to your specifications in a pretty location. The land costs nothing, and hiring a few dozen kobolds is pretty cheap. They often build towers for kidnapped princesses on dragon orders and love working with stone, so they happily work as builders even in human lands.

![Sweet Home](images/R47C2.avif)

### Abandoned Ruins

You've found a tower among the ruins with an extensive underground section. Four floors and a cave going even deeper, though blocked by stones, as if someone feared what might come from there. Odd that it hasn't turned into a monster-filled dungeon yet... Well, now you're here! And you'll definitely set traps and beat up any intruders!

![Abandoned Ruins](images/R47C3.avif)

### Dragon's Den

At first, the huge cave in the mountains seemed too big and empty... But all your dragon instincts screamed - this is the perfect lair! Here you can spread your wings, curl up on the pile of treasure you’ll surely acquire, and enjoy the great mountain view! Umm... Maybe right now you're small, but you'll grow, right?

![Dragon's Den](images/R47C4.avif)

### Sky Island

You've heard legends of a floating island where a mighty sorceress once lived. Abandoned and drained of energy, it lay in dangerous lands, making it horribly hard to find and even harder to recharge and learn to control. But now you can travel in comfort! Though, dragons love to drop by, which is why the sorceress abandoned it...

![Sky Island](images/R47C5.avif)

## Discriminations



## 



### Discrimination

People fear dragons, so they take it out on half-dragons. Or rather, the scaly weaklings sometimes found in these lands. But even you, with your great blood, will face discrimination... But you desperately don't want to lose your human half and live like a wild monster! So you'll have to endure it to live among humans...

![Discrimination](images/R49C1.avif)

### Pat Down Parade

People often check to see if you have weapons or dangerous items hidden in your bra? When you enter a town, a tavern, a club or even a shop, your breasts, buttocks and even your crotch will be thoroughly searched. Just stand still and take it, or you won't be let in! And forcing your way in is not an option - the whole guard will be on you!

![Pat Down Parade](images/R49C2.avif)

### Strip Search

Apparently, a pat-down isn't enough; you might be hiding under armor that's hard to feel! So you must strip and show your bare body to anyone who orders you. Don’t forget to lift that tail high and spread your ass cheeks to prove nothing’s hidden there! They might even stick a few fingers into any hole!

![Strip Search](images/R49C3.avif)

### Taste of Humans

Surely you're used to sucking off monsters, you filthy slut! But people will try to make you enjoy the taste of humans! All the food served to you will be covered in sperm or female juices. Or just spit! And you have to eat it, showing everyone how much you like it! You can refuse an unappetizing dish, but you must lick up the cum!

![Taste of Humans](images/R49C4.avif)

### No Fight

You're strictly forbidden from fighting or harming people in inhabited lands unless they’re clearly trying to kill you. You can't even resist rapists because if he trips chasing you, or you push him, he can complain to the guards, and they'll side with him! So just take whatever they do to you, and don't forget to warn about sharp scales so he doesn't get scratched!

![No Fight](images/R49C5.avif)

### Nose Ring

Everyone knows that half-dragons are super strong, so to make you easier to control, you'll have to wear a nose ring. It's a very sensitive spot, so if someone pulls on it, even you won't be able to resist!

![Nose Ring](images/R49C6.avif)

### Collared

As long as you're within the city, you must always wear this cursed collar enchanted for obedience. No, it's not slavery! You'll just have to follow any perverted orders for 15 minutes per person. That's enough time for them to order you to choke yourself with the nearest cock!

![Collared](images/R49C7.avif)

### Safety Suit

During important visits or events, guards will dress you in this super-safe suit. You won't be able to use your hands, and walking will be a struggle, but hey, at least you're not in prison! You can still walk around wherever you want!

![Safety Suit](images/R49C8.avif)

### Monthly Check-Ups

Every month, guards will personally check that you're non-aggressive and law-abiding, and give you additional training. Just a couple of days in jail, a light stress to check that you are able to control yourself and react properly to unexpected situations by putting your ass on the line!

![Monthly Check-Ups](images/R49C9.avif)

### Public Display

The townsfolk are still damn scared of you and would rather attack you than live nearby... Luckily, guards have found a way to calm them down and show you're safe! You'll spend a week on the main square accessible to everyone! They can use you as much as they want until convinced you're an obedient bitch!

![Public Display](images/R49C10.avif)

### Creamy Delights

Your milk is not only brimming with energy but also incredibly tasty! Sorceresses would pull each other's hair for it, so you must supply city mages with at least a liter of this nectar. Better yet, two. Or ten! They're willing to pay for extra milk!

![Creamy Delights](images/R49C11.avif)

### Golden Goose

Yes, your empty eggs aren't quite like dragon ones, but they're still useful for many great rituals... So you must give them to the townsfolk. By the way, sometimes they can even be bought at a restaurant and they cost a bloody fortune! But of course, you can keep fertilized eggs for yourself.

![Golden Goose](images/R49C12.avif)

### Cum Collector

Monster sperm is also highly valued, but it's hard and dangerous to obtain. Lucky you're so tough, right? So go and serve the city! At least a bucket a day! However, you can bring sperm right in your belly, witches will help it flow out.

![Cum Collector](images/R49C13.avif)

### Payment

Many believe, not without reason, that dragon gold is cursed and will inevitably disappear, returning to its owner with other coins! So no one will accept even a penny from you, and you can only pay for goods and services with your body.

![Payment](images/R49C14.avif)

### Daily Quota

You must serve 20 people right on the street every day so no one forgets that you're not a dangerous monster but just the town slut. You need to be humiliated and raped so no one fears you. Ah yes, if there are no guys - use stray dogs or something like that.

![Daily Quota](images/R49C15.avif)

### Punishment

They'll never dare execute you or keep you in prison for more than a week, fearing it might anger the true dragons. No matter what you do, you'll be released, but first, they'll humiliate and fuck you in the most brutal ways, so even your sturdy dragon pussy will hurt for a week.

![Punishment](images/R49C16.avif)

### Annual Auction

Actually, there aren't many well-trained half-dragon sluts like you, and the tender, dense pussies of such half-breeds are highly prized... So, once a year, the city will auction you off! On the first day, the richest guests will enjoy you! Then a week with simpler travelers, and the last day - anyone with a couple coins!

![Annual Auction](images/R49C17.avif)

### Wyverns Ho

Everyone loves a good show, so once a month you'll be chained up and released on stage with a young, fierce... Wyvern. Well, not a real dragon, of course! Anyway, everyone will eagerly watch as it rapes you. Yelling that you're a dragon slut! Tickets for such shows cost a fortune, so if you want to earn, just repeat it!

![Wyverns Ho](images/R49C18.avif)

### Swine Soiree

You're doing great, slut! But everyone's damn curious about what else you can take! Right after the wyvern, dirty pigs will rape you while the audience laughs, seeing how eagerly you take their cocks just to live among humans! After this, no one will believe you have even a drop of pride or dare disobey humans!

![Swine Soiree](images/R49C19.avif)

### Trust Trial

Once a year, you'll undergo the ultimate test, where you must entrust them with your life. You must enter the cage yourself, take the strongest drugs that will sap your strength, and let them tie you up. You'll spend several days in total darkness and helplessness. They'll take you somewhere, but you won't even remember what they did to you afterward.

![Trust Trial](images/R49C20.avif)

### NEXT



![NEXT]()

##  Mental Changes

Not so long ago, you thought that only your body had changed. You may be covered in scales and have a tail, but inside you are still the same person you were before!
But it seems the dragon's blood has changed you way more than you thought. Maybe it's the instincts of your new body, maybe you just went a little crazy in the new world, or maybe the magic has changed your very soul, but now you're going to have to get used to your new mental traits

## Positive



## 



### Body Pride

You're damn proud of your new, strong, beautiful body and feel fantastic walking around naked. You know for sure that your tits, your hips, your scales are perfect, and no clothing could ever top them! Even if someone tries to shame you, you'll just laugh it off, confident in your perfection, because everyone loves your perfect tits!

![Body Pride](images/R53C1.avif)

### Perfect Style

When it comes to clothing, you have an incredibly refined sense of style. You instinctively know how to wear any ragged piece of cloth to make it look luxurious. Hell, you can buy clothes from a cheap shop, make a few adjustments with a needle and thread, and look better than an aristocrat who spent a week with an expensive tailor!

![Perfect Style](images/R53C2.avif)

### Flashy Pose

You always strike incredibly epic poses without even thinking about it. It might look a bit funny when you're doing something mundane, but during battles, even your enemies will be left breathless by how epic and cool you look! Many will consider you a legendary hero just for that!

![Flashy Pose](images/R53C3.avif)

### Sense of Profit

One of your additional senses is for gold and profit, which always allows you to buy at the lowest possible price and sell anything with maximum profit! Even without considering others' offers, you can practically smell a good deal or a scam, so just follow your nose and you'll be rich as a dragon!

![Sense of Profit](images/R53C4.avif)

### Charming

You might be a monster, but you're a damn charming one! You always know what to say, when and how to smile, and how to wag your tail and butt to leave the best impression on those around you. Just a few minutes with you and anyone will admit that even your scary horns make you even hotter!

![Charming](images/R53C5.avif)

### Life of the Party

You're great at smoothing over any conflicts, and people enjoy being around you so much that you'll never have trouble gathering a party of adventurers. Even if some of them would normally fight, as long as they're your companions, they'll see old grudges and others' flaws as trivial.

![Life of the Party](images/R53C6.avif)

### Cheerful

No matter what happens, you always remain incredibly cheerful and fun. Your funny jokes and pranks can make people smile even in the scariest dungeon and turn your whole life into a never-ending party. 

![Cheerful](images/R53C7.avif)

### Genki

Laziness? Apathy? You can forget about those silly words because now you're bursting with energy! Ha, you rarely just walk; you run through the streets, eager to do as much as possible in the shortest time! Your energy even rubs off on those around you, inspiring the lazy!

![Genki](images/R53C8.avif)

### Golden Voice

You have an incredibly pleasant voice, so much so that even if you read a financial report on stage, you'll still easily gather a full audience. Amazingly, many will even remember the important numbers from the report, as if your golden voice somehow helps them! In any case, your songs and especially your moans sound fantastic! 

![Golden Voice](images/R53C9.avif)

### Trap Sensing

Dragons are incredibly hard to catch off guard with an ambush or trap. You literally sense it in advance! Just a second or two, but that's almost always enough to dodge danger or catch a friend who's about to fall into a pit of spikes. 

![Trap Sensing](images/R53C10.avif)

### Tech-Savvy

Well, you're from a more technologically advanced era, so you remember a ton of technical knowledge. Even if you just saw someone assembling tech on YouTube or glanced at complex blueprints for a second, the magic of blood will gather all these bits of valuable knowledge from your subconscious and make you a true master technician! 

![Tech-Savvy](images/R53C11.avif)

### Ancient Lore

Actually, there's a surprising amount of useful stuff in your memory... Ancient languages, programs, security system details, hacking methods... you couldn't have been a criminal, right? Haha! In any case, you feel right at home in ancient ruins! ...and if you don't take this perk, even remembering English will be tough. 

![Ancient Lore](images/R53C12.avif)

### Smart Ass

Of course, in your past life, you only saw the rage of great dragons, but they are actually incredibly intelligent. Their minds are incomparable to human ones, as they can think in terms of 18 dimensions, making them faster than even supercomputers! But... uh, such a great brain won't fit in your scull. So just +100 IQ. 

![Smart Ass](images/R53C13.avif)

### Epiphany

Actually, there's a way to cheat a little... Make you, for just a second... uh, not as smart as a great dragon, but you'll have 3 percent of that. It will require all your mana, and you can only do it once a month, but for a brief moment, you'll surpass all human geniuses and even young dragons, allowing you to solve almost any problem. 

![Epiphany](images/R53C14.avif)

### Natural Talent

Oh, you must have been something in your past life... Some parts of your brain are clearly more developed than those of other humans... You had some talent, right? Maybe you're an amazing artist? Writer? Tactician? Whatever it is, it can be enhanced 10 times! One of your natural talents will become truly incredible! 

![Natural Talent](images/R53C15.avif)

### Evil Genius

You were definitely a criminal in the past. You even robbed a museum to steal that damn jade spear! Surely you were a bad boy before that too, and that's good! Now you'll become a true evil genius! This has various synergies, so if you're tech-savvy, you'll be especially good at creating weapons. Or organizing gangs! Or taking down enemies solo! Or all of the above! 

![Evil Genius](images/R53C16.avif)

### Devious

Deception is your second nature. Cunning and slippery, you'll never get tangled in your own elaborate lies and skillfully weave them with bits of truth to outsmart stupid mortal humans. Also, you don't even need to worry about being deceived yourself - you'll just feel it as if lies have a special smell.

![Devious](images/R53C17.avif)

### Battle Fury

The blood of a great dragon flows in you, which means that fights and brawls only fuel your passion! The stronger the enemy, the harder the fight - the better! This rage will make you even stronger, even meaner, even faster! Even if there are millions of enemies - you'll never give up or get tired even if you have to fight for many years without stopping! You can always devour a couple of enemies right during the battle!

![Battle Fury](images/R53C18.avif)

### Loyal

You are incredibly loyal to your friends and companions, and once you call someone your comrade, you'll be ready to fight for them to the last drop of blood... of their enemies. For your friends, you're willing to declare war on entire kingdoms or travel to the ends of the earth. What? No, this isn't a flaw, you stupid human! Others will always feel this and especially value your trust, responding with the same loyalty to you!

![Loyal](images/R53C19.avif)

### Self Sacrifice

Sometimes you can't solve a problem with just a sword and claws... But for your friends, you're willing to make great sacrifices! And if a monster has already captured them, you'll readily offer yourself in exchange! Because you're tough, you can handle it! Or if there are too many monsters and the party can't escape, you'll stay behind alone and even drop your weapon so that all the monsters focus their attention only on you!

![Self Sacrifice](images/R53C20.avif)

### Ironclad Promise

Hmm? Why would monsters believe you? Foolish mortal - dragons always keep their word, and everyone feels this! And if you say that in exchange for a captive comrade you'll let them rape you for a week - that's exactly what you'll do! No matter how terrible and humiliating it is, you'll obediently take load after load of cum... even if no one sees it, even if as soon as the agreed time is up, you'll kill them all!

![Ironclad Promise](images/R53C21.avif)

### Draconic Memory

Dragons not only remember all their promises, even those made thousands of years ago, but also remember all the wrongs done to them. And they love to take revenge! Oh, don't worry, a great dragon is unlikely to seek revenge for that spear thrust that made the battle a bit more exciting, or they would have incinerated you right away. In fact, they never forget anything. And now you'll have the same photographic memory! 

![Draconic Memory](images/R53C22.avif)

### Unbreakable Will

Remember how you were dying buried under the ruins? That was the last time you thought about giving up. Yeah, it would have been a worthy death, and you possess dragon blood by right... But now you'll never give up under any circumstances! No despair or torture can break you. Even if your arms and legs are cut off, and you're fucked like a doll for a hundred years, even if evil gods torture you for thousands of years - you won't give up or lose your mind.

![Unbreakable Will](images/R53C23.avif)

### Terrifying

Haha, oh yeah, dragons know how to be scary! Now you possess a piece of this gift! When you get really angry, one furious glance from you will be enough to make hardened bandits wet themselves, and many monsters flee in terror. Even brave heroes will have to strain seriously so that the sword in their hands doesn't tremble, showing fear!

![Terrifying](images/R53C24.avif)

### Dragon Aura

You possess the aura of a true dragon. Maybe a very small and young one. Probably the smallest in this world, but still a true dragon! Your fierce roar is now even more terrifying, and even the most horrible monsters will be afraid to kill you, fearing retribution from your kin, and will just rape and release you after a couple of weeks. Oh yes, young dragons will also accept you as their little sister!

![Dragon Aura](images/R53C25.avif)

## Negative



## 



### Superior Race

In your veins flows the blood of a great dragon. Your scales, your horns, your sharp wit, your power, your majesty - you outshine humans in every way! Everyone should simply acknowledge this, bow before you, and beg to kiss your beautiful feet!

![Superior Race](images/R55C1.avif)

### Selfish

You couldn't care less about others' opinions, and your partner's pleasure during sex is the last thing on your mind. You'll fuck as you please, ignoring their pleas, cries, and begging. You won't stop for a second, not even if they just came.

![Selfish](images/R55C2.avif)

### Spoiled

You're like a spoiled little princess, always convinced that you're right and everyone should instantly obey your every command, no matter how silly or absurd. You'll mercilessly torment your squad members, barmaids in taverns, and more, and get very upset if they don't listen to you.

![Spoiled](images/R55C3.avif)

### Childish

Seriously? Stop acting like a child, grow up already! You're hundreds of years old if you count all the time you spent unconscious under the rubble! No, no, definitely no diapers and pacifiers, go to hell! Just enjoy some funny, silly games and pranks!

![Childish](images/R55C4.avif)

### Decadence

You behave like a refined aristocrat in your depravity and moral decay. Luxury, power, perversions... It's amazing how the ideas of the Marquis de Sade have survived all these centuries. Many young aristocrats will gladly welcome you into their exclusive clubs!

![Decadence](images/R55C5.avif)

### Labyrinth

Many monster girls get lost in cities when they first arrive, but your situation is even worse. Without a good map, you'll easily get lost even if there are only a few streets! And in a big city, even a map won't always save you.

![Labyrinth](images/R55C6.avif)

### Fear of the Dark

Uh, no, wait, you can't be... oh no. No, dragons can't have silly human phobias! Even if you spent hundreds of years under the rubble, that's no reason to be afraid of the dark! Oh, wait... ah, it's all good! In a few minutes, you'll lose control and start breathing fire! Let everyone around be afraid!

![Fear of the Dark](images/R55C7.avif)

### Sweet Tooth

You incredibly love sweets and especially fresh, aromatic baked goods. All those cakes, pastries, and donuts are so delicious! And the cakes! Ah! You're ready to eat only them and often dream of opening your own bakery where you can enjoy the rarest and most delicious buns by making them yourself!

![Sweet Tooth](images/R55C8.avif)

### Trashy

You have a very strange taste in clothing... Thongs, fishnet stockings, ridiculous bright labels... Even hookers usually shy away from dressing so trashy and provocative! It's amazing where you can even find such clothes, since there are no online sex shops here?

![Trashy](images/R55C9.avif)

### Exorcist

Like most dragons, you hate the undead and always destroy them. Damn skeletons, zombies, and liches, they stink terribly and infect everything with their cursed decay! They are unnatural! Maybe dragons have left humans alone, but any dragon will surely incinerate any necropolis!

![Exorcist](images/R55C10.avif)

### Overreact

Your emotions are so intense that they can't be hidden or controlled. When you're happy, you literally jump for joy and hug even random passersby. But if you get sad, you cry loudly like a child and hide under a blanket from sorrow. Oh, and your screams during orgasms are also amazing!

![Overreact](images/R55C11.avif)

### Touchy

You are incredibly touchy. Sometimes just a slight nudge or the wrong word, and you literally lose control from being offended. Even you don't know what will happen next! Maybe you'll burst into tears or start screaming, maybe run away, or maybe start fighting!

![Touchy](images/R55C12.avif)

### Frozen

You're damn strong and dangerous as a half-dragon. One careless move, and you can easily hurt someone with your scales! Therefore, you are very afraid of hurting people, and if there is no direct threat to your life, you freeze for a minute while being groped, not knowing what to do. And if they then leave, you prefer to just forget about it.

![Frozen](images/R55C13.avif)

### Reveling in Terror

You enjoy others' fear, revel in the scent of a terrified victim, and even if you can't see it, it's damn pleasant to imagine how they will react to your message. I mean, they should understand what a horse's head in the bed means, right? Uh, maybe it's better to leave a note...

![Reveling in Terror](images/R55C14.avif)

### Alcoholic Rampage

Alcohol affects you very strongly, but instead of quietly falling asleep, you completely lose control and start acting like an asshole. Screaming, fighting, throwing bottles, losing at cards, yell that you're a disco star, grabbing girls' asses, intimidating and raping everyone around. You'll be very ashamed afterward, right? Right?

![Alcoholic Rampage](images/R55C15.avif)

### Flirty

Flirting is too much fun to stop for even a minute! You always try to tease the guys around you, dress as provocatively as possible, smile invitingly, lick your lips, show that you're not wearing panties today... But, hey, it doesn't mean anything or promise anything! You're just having fun! It's just a game!

![Flirty](images/R55C16.avif)

### Bully

For some reason, instead of being gentle with someone you like, you start teasing and annoying them. Well... uh... Maybe you think this is a great way to show your love? Perhaps someone who knows you well can figure out what this means, but usually, people will just get offended... or enjoy it if they're masochists!

![Bully](images/R55C17.avif)

### Sexual Teasing

Okay, I think now it will be much easier for them to guess your feelings, because now you'll tease them exclusively in a sexual way. For example, you'll try to smother them with your crotch! Or spank their ass! Or hide all their clothes and make them walk around naked! But it will still be quite offensive!

![Sexual Teasing](images/R55C18.avif)

### Yandere

Ha, what's the point of teasing people if you can just make them love you! A little sharp steel at their throat, and they certainly won't run away until they feel all your love and tenderness! The main thing is that your beloved is with you, right? And if you have to tie them up for that... It's for their own good!

![Yandere](images/R55C19.avif)

### Carrying

For some reason, you really like carrying people on your back. Uh, this happens among dragons and is usually considered terribly shameful kink... But it seems that among humans, they see it as just a fun game, so enjoy! You're strong enough to run without even noticing their weight, right? Or do you prefer to walk on all fours?

![Carrying](images/R55C20.avif)

### Arrogance

Arrogance is practically your second name. Beautiful and powerful, you are always incredibly cold and haughty to strangers, and even your friends often grit their teeth and want to punch you in the face to wipe that arrogant smile off. You're so annoying that many would prefer you to curse like a sailor!

![Arrogance](images/R55C21.avif)

### Picky

Although your iron stomach can now digest anything, you've also become much more sensitive to smells and tastes of food, so you've become incredibly picky. Finding something tasty for you is very difficult, and you often disgustedly throw away even expensive steaks just because they slightly messed up the spices.

![Picky](images/R55C22.avif)

### Sense of Duty

You have a very strong sense of duty, so if someone ever saves your life, you'll consider it your duty to repay them properly. For example, save them ten times! Your life is more valuable than theirs, so that's fair, right? Well, or if they don't fight, then at least serve them as a willing maid for a few years!

![Sense of Duty](images/R55C23.avif)

### Nonconformist

You are annoyed by all kinds of stupid prohibitions, laws and opinions of the majority. Not so much that you become a criminal just because of it, but you often try to do the opposite just out of principle. You will often try to do the opposite to spite everyone, even if it is less convenient than just following traditions. 

![Nonconformist](images/R55C24.avif)

### Troublemaker

Laws? Screw the laws! You don't even think about them while having fun! Usually, this leads to big trouble for everyone around, because after causing trouble, you try to run away as far as possible! Ah, damn, you really cause so many problems... And that cheeky smile... Ugh, one day you'll definitely end up in jail!

![Troublemaker](images/R55C25.avif)

### Sleepyhead

You love to sleep and hate early mornings. I mean, practically any morning, unless you've been sleeping on a pile of treasure in your lair for a few months. But you probably won't be able to do that often in the next few years, so you'll always be angry, irritable, and grumpy in the morning.

![Sleepyhead](images/R55C26.avif)

### Greedy

Gold, gold, gold! And platinum! And iridium! Damn, you just love the shine of gold, it's literally the embodiment of power and strength! And it feels so nice... It's so nice to sleep on it... Ah, it seems you're becoming as greedy for treasure as dragons!

![Greedy](images/R55C27.avif)

### Whore

You're so greedy that the easiest way to defeat you is... to buy your defeat. You're literally willing to drop your pants before a fight if they pay you... Oh... or just "surrender" for a few hours... I mean, it's not hard at all, and even pleasant, and they pay with solid gold!

![Whore](images/R55C28.avif)

### Too Hot Blooded

Even though you're a fearsome half-dragon, and even though fire is your element and all that, your human half can't get used to the new, higher body temperature, and you always feel hot. Especially in the summer when it's really hot!

![Too Hot Blooded](images/R55C29.avif)

### Armor Averse

Armor? Screw that, you have your beautiful, strong scales! They'll protect you better than any pathetic metal... even if your chest or belly isn't covered, so what? Armor is too heavy and uncomfortable, it only restricts you! Oh... okay, you just don't want to wear it!

![Armor Averse](images/R55C30.avif)

### Coward

No, no, no! Dragons fear nothing! Even a half-dragon like you is brave and resolute! And you're not screaming in terror, you're distracting the enemy with a scream! ...and taking a more advantageous position for a counterattack! You're going to... You're going to counterattack that mouse, right?

![Coward](images/R55C31.avif)

### Fighting Spirit

Fights are what make your heart beat faster! This passion, this excitement... It's almost like love! You're ready to fight anyone, and you don't even need a reason! You're even ready to offer a reward to the winner! A dozen guys in a tavern? Great! This will be damn fun!

![Fighting Spirit](images/R55C32.avif)

### Real Challenge

Fighting mortals is so boring! You need a real challenge! A fight with a dragon! Although, young dragons like such foreplay before sex and are always happy to have fun with you! ...but even if you lose a couple of times, you won't give up! Even if your ass hurts now, one day you'll definitely win!

![Real Challenge](images/R55C33.avif)

### Might Makes Right

You're firmly convinced that might makes right. And that only absolute power will allow you to live the way you want! And so you won't stop at anything to become stronger! Steal an artifact, betray an entire nation, rob a tomb - anything for power!

![Might Makes Right](images/R55C34.avif)

### Real Evil

People will always consider you evil, a dark messiah... Oh, uh... Wait... Am I mistaken or are you really a very bad boy? I mean, did you really have to burn that village to the ground? You were just passing by! Oh... Take it easy, man, you're even scaring me...

![Real Evil](images/R55C35.avif)

## Lewd



## 



### Pervert

This debauched world is having a really bad influence on you... Hmm... Or were you always a pervert? If you think about it, you've probably seen way more naked butts, dicks, and pussies than most people in this world, since you've probably seen a ton of porn. How many porn actresses have spread their legs for you? Tens of thousands? So it's no wonder you see lewd overtones everywhere.

![Pervert](images/R57C1.avif)

### Slutty

Um... Are you sure this is still called flirting? Mooning, fellatio gestures... Hey, you even want to take off your panties to show everything properly? I'm not even sure this can be called "teasing" or anything like that! You're literally begging everyone around to fuck you quickly! And don't tell me you're not doing it on purpose!

![Slutty](images/R57C2.avif)

### Heat

Because dragons only go into heat once every few years! Well... Maybe once a year... Ugh, it seems like you have it every two weeks? There's something wrong with your hormones, they'll literally overwhelm your brain! I don't think you'll be able to control yourself at all during that time and say anything other than "more!" and "deeper!"... Well... Uh... But the orgasms are stronger during that time!

![Heat](images/R57C3.avif)

### Unstoppable

Nice, right? Soft, wet pussy... firm clit... Ah.. Ah... Oh, definitely... Ah... Hey, wait! Ah... ahh... Well, it seems like once you start... ahh... masturbating, you won't be able to stop! AHHH!!! Until you come! Phew, the main thing is to put on your panties right away and get busy with important things or... Ah... damn, or you'll just start all over again!! Ah!!!

![Unstoppable](images/R57C4.avif)

### Unconditional Reflex

It's so pleasant that your body literally moves on its own. As soon as you insert a dick into your pussy, your hips won't stop! Hah, even if you're being raped, soon the rapist will be begging for mercy while you rhythmically impale yourself on his dick, enjoying the penetration and the sounds of juicy slaps of sweaty flesh!

![Unconditional Reflex](images/R57C5.avif)

### Sweetest Treat

You know exactly what's the tastiest thing in this world for you! Peaches! I mean, sweet, wet, dripping with lust girl pussies! Their juices are like divine nectar for you, and you're ready to work your tongue for many hours!

![Sweetest Treat](images/R57C6.avif)

### Meaty Candy

The best meaty candy in the world! Dicks are so tasty that you'd prefer them even... Wait, do you really have to choose what's better? I mean, you can enjoy all the treats one by one, no need to limit yourself to just one thing!

![Meaty Candy](images/R57C7.avif)

### Deeper

Your throat is not only very resilient but also incredibly sensitive. It's the perfect hole for fucking, and you always prefer deepthroat to a regular blowjob. And if someone grabs your head and just starts fucking your skull, pounding with all their might - that's even better!

![Deeper](images/R57C8.avif)

### Morning Hunt

Everything in the world has its purpose, and even a morning hard-on isn't just for nothing! It's a special energy boost meant for girls who have trouble waking up! And now, knowing this secret, every morning you'll strive to suck some dick to perk up!

![Morning Hunt](images/R57C9.avif)

### Turboslut

Dragons are the best at everything! And you should be the best too! At everything! Even when it comes to perversions! You'll become a turbo-slut who enjoys humiliations more than any other bitch! Who's ready to take anything and ask for more!

![Turboslut](images/R57C10.avif)

### Toy Boys

Little or just short guys are like great cute toys for you! It's so thrilling when you can completely control them! When there's always someone to rest your breasts on!

![Toy Boys](images/R57C11.avif)

### Big Boys

Big strong dudes are your favorite type! So they can lift you up and use you like a doll! Ugh, even if you can be stronger than them, it's still so nice when they squeeze you in their arms!

![Big Boys](images/R57C12.avif)

### Lesbian

Guys? Screw guys! Only gentle and sensual girls are worthy of your love! I mean, of course, you can use guys, but they're just living dildos to you. How can you even fall in love with a dildo?

![Lesbian](images/R57C13.avif)

### Dragon Ball

You're sure that one day these pearls will be imbued with power and grant wishes! Haha, just kidding! Without them, your butt feels so lonely! It feels so empty! Well... it seems that at least this wish of fullness can be granted by these beads!

![Dragon Ball](images/R57C14.avif)

### Hunting Instinct

You have a strong hunting instinct, so when you see a guy hugging another girl... You immediately want to conquer him! Let him fuck you at least once, cheating on his girlfriend! You'll allow him anything, just to feel like you've won!

![Hunting Instinct](images/R57C15.avif)

### Masochist's Grip

You have a grip like a bulldog, and if you catch someone, you won't let go! And if someone starts fucking you, your tail will wrap around your partner and won't let go until they come at least three times. That's your prey! Oh... Or are you just a masochist who loves pain and submission?

![Masochist's Grip](images/R57C16.avif)

### Leash Trained

Mmm... It seems you're a very, very obedient girl and well-trained. You never run away from the leash and don't break the ropes if it's beautiful shibari. You're very patient and always do what your master tells you... Wait, do you even have a master?

![Leash Trained](images/R57C17.avif)

### Switch

You enjoy both submitting to others and controlling them during sex. So every time you take a collar in your hands, you'll decide who will wear it today. Who will be the bad girl and whose butt will be so pleasantly sore after the spanking.

![Switch](images/R57C18.avif)

### Dominant

Your favorite sex toy? Of course, it's the whip in your hands! You love controlling others, humiliating, forcing, training them, and even breaking their will a little! Ah, it's so pleasant that your panties get soaked through! You can even come just from this!

![Dominant](images/R57C19.avif)

### Rapist

Dragons rarely ask for permission. And if you have a dick - just catch someone, knock them down, and shove your huge cock into that tight hole balls deep! And those screams and pitiful attempts to resist only make the rape more enjoyable!

![Rapist](images/R57C20.avif)

### Sold

You're not just willing to endure and let yourself be fucked for money like a common whore, oh no. The mere thought that you're being bought like an object, that during the paid time you're just a meat doll for fucking who will do anything, turns you on so much that you'll suck off a bum for a handful of coins with much more pleasure than letting a prince lick your ass.

![Sold](images/R57C21.avif)

### After Match

Adrenaline is not just your drug, now it's also the best aphrodisiac for you! Any battle turns you on so much that in the end, you don't care who won! You'll fuck your victim yourself or willingly spread your legs for the winner - what's the difference? As long as you cum as soon as possible! Ten times! Ah, battles with crowds of monsters are the best!

![After Match](images/R57C22.avif)

### Insatiable Desire

You're too resilient for just one guy to satisfy you, unless it's some legendary lover. Even a monster like a minotaur might not be enough, so you always prefer group sex. Two guys minimum! Ideally, two guys for each hole!

![Insatiable Desire](images/R57C23.avif)

### Scaly Kink

Nagas, lamias, snake girls, lizard girls... Even snake boys and lizard boys! Even the crocodile people! They're all so cool, so scaly, that you always prefer sex with them! I mean, ordinary people don't have scales!

![Scaly Kink](images/R57C24.avif)

### Dragon Lust

Oh, who are you kidding... You know exactly which dick you need! Who turns you on the most, whose seed your womb craves! Dragons! True dragons! Your pussy is meant for them! All your holes! You're just a bitch who lives only for their great cocks!

![Dragon Lust](images/R57C25.avif)

## 



### NEXT



![NEXT]()

## Perks

A penchant for battles, lust, some silly quirks... These things can happen to anyone! They're mere trifles! After all, everyone is unique, and each person has an interesting peculiarity!

Especially in this new, crazy world...

But there's still something that sets you apart from ordinary mortals! Because dragons aren't just about tough scales and a firm ass!

## Dragon's Breath



## 



### Spark

All dragons can breathe fire, it's as natural as breathing itself! Look, even you can exhale a little bit. It's not difficult at all, right? And very convenient! You probably won't be able to deal with your enemies with such a small spark, but at least you'll never need matches again!

![Spark](images/R61C1.avif)

### Flare

Wow! You're doing great! A powerful burst of fire over several meters will surprise any opponent and save you more than once, because this weapon is always with you! Half-dragons usually can't do this, so no one will be expecting something so dangerous.

![Flare](images/R61C2.avif)

### Inferno

Uh, wait... what... How did you do that?! You're... you're half-human, you're so small! How did you manage to burn everything around you like a real dragon?! You alone can replace a dozen flamethrowers by creating a true firestorm!

![Inferno](images/R61C3.avif)

### Eruption

You can exhale a particularly powerful stream of flame twice as far, but you must prepare well and take a very deep breath before attacking. Wait, why are your boobs glowing? Oh, that's what your breasts are for! Then you need to grow them even bigger!

![Eruption](images/R61C4.avif)

### Overheat

You don't get exhausted after a dozen attacks, so you can exhale fire again and again. In this mode, your entire body heats up to a red glow, and your attacks become even more powerful! But keep in mind that your defense significantly weakens, especially against water.

![Overheat](images/R61C5.avif)

### Raging Flame

Attacking with your fiery breath is so natural for you that you barely control it. If you get angry, instead of the next insult to your enemy, you might accidentally unleash a powerful stream of flame. Well... Not the most powerful, you probably won't incinerate them on the spot, so you'll have to apologize a lot or resolve the problem once and for all.

![Raging Flame](images/R61C6.avif)

### Fiery Hiccups

You have excellent control over your inner fire and heat. You can even exhale a thin stream to light a cigarette and never accidentally set anything on fire. Only when you hiccup do you release small puffs of fire, but it actually looks very cute!

![Fiery Hiccups](images/R61C7.avif)

### Fine Control

Your control over fire is incredible - you can easily burn your signature onto something from several meters away, or swat a fly in mid-air. Or even incinerate a mosquito sitting on your friend's skin without them feeling the heat! Hell, you can even burn a hole in your opponent's armor without scorching them!

![Fine Control](images/R61C8.avif)

### Ignited

When you're in a rage or in battle, your body heats up and prepares for you to attack with fire faster and stronger. For dragons, this usually only causes a little smoke from the throat, but you'll blaze like a living torch! With each exhale, a bit of bright flame will escape from your mouth, so you definitely won't be able to hide at night!

![Ignited](images/R61C9.avif)

### Double Element

Hmm... It seems you had a hidden talent for magic in your previous life. Very weak and undeveloped, but it doesn't matter, because it's easy to fix... Now you have two magic cores and can use two elements at the same time! Huh? Oh no, fiery breath doesn't count, it's just an attribute of your body!

![Double Element](images/R61C10.avif)

## Your Element



## 



### Unquenchable Flame

You will be able to breathe incredibly hot flames that can burn for several years, even on bare rocks. To extinguish it, you only need to will it. 
Additionally, you will find it incredibly easy to control magical fire, so you will quickly learn the basic spells of this school.

![Unquenchable Flame](images/R63C1.avif)

### Wildfire

Your flames can burn for hundreds of years, melting any metal and stones. You will also be able to summon fire elementals. These are incredibly willful creatures that usually live in the depths of lava, hidden from humans, and are very difficult to control, but... Just summon one and it will happily burn all your enemies! And the city... And the forest... and everything around if you're not careful!

![Wildfire](images/R63C2.avif)

### Frost

A rare element for dragons, but it does occur... usually in those whose fire breath is not as powerful. Oh, no, no, there's nothing to be ashamed of! All dragons are unique, and that's their strength! Anyway, you will be able to freeze everything, sell magic fridges, and build great ice rinks! Oh, well... maybe you can attack somehow. I don't know.

![Frost](images/R63C3.avif)

### Ice

Oh, you can create ice out of thin air! Great, now you can throw icicles at your enemies! Hey, this is much more dangerous than it looks! They are very heavy! If you train well, you might even be able to turn your enemies into ice statues! Or even build your own ice palace with beautiful ice patterns and giant snowflakes!

![Ice](images/R63C4.avif)

### Nature

Creating forests and controlling plants isn't something you'd expect fire-breathing dragons to do, right? But actually, many of the forests in this world were created by them! Living in ashen wastelands is boring as hell, and there's nothing to hunt... So they even greened some of the deserts created by humans! You too can now grow any plant in a matter of seconds. For example, a rare healing herb or a tree with a house inside!

![Nature](images/R63C5.avif)

### Friends

Plants and animals instinctively sense and are drawn to those who possess nature magic. They will all take care of you, protect, and guard you without asking for anything in return, as your magic is beneficial to this world. Even monsters will be much kinder to you! Although only those that are not too intelligent... Oh, by the way, in this world, there must be dryads! Usually, they hide, but maybe even they will want to meet you!

![Friends](images/R63C6.avif)

### Blood

Magic of blood, magic of life. Incredibly dangerous, as you can literally drain the blood from your enemy! Well... If they have blood, of course. You will also instinctively sense the internal structure of people, their diseases, and how to heal them, so you can become an excellent healer. Or just store life energy from enemies and heal your friends with it.

![Blood](images/R63C7.avif)

### Mutaginesis

You will be able to not only heal, but actively enhance any living creature! Through targeted mutations enhanced by magic, you can easily give someone a few extra arms! You can even slightly rewire their nervous system so they can use it as their own! Or you can stitch together several organisms to create a single chimera!

![Mutaginesis](images/R63C8.avif)

### Curses

Evil, black magic that allows you to curse people or lands... Usually, this means a hell of a lot of fun for the spellcaster! I mean, a dragon's "combat curse" usually kills its enemy almost instantly, so everyone just has fun playing with their victims! Silly mishaps, torn clothes, speech filters, all sorts of perverted stuff! Hey, or did you think all those cursed lands with hentai auras appeared by accident? Of course not! Some dragons love messing with humans, but usually, they try not to make them suffer too much so as not to break them.

![Curses](images/R63C9.avif)

### Necromantic

Dragons hate the undead, so don't even think about raising the dead! You'll stink of that disgusting corpse smell! If they find out, you definitely won't be accepted into any pack, and they might even track you down and burn you. But you can put even the most powerful liches and armies of the undead to rest with a snap of your fingers. And summon the spirits of the dead and various ghosts. Well, if the soul hasn't been reborn, so you probably won't be able to talk to someone from your time. Oh... Wait... You can even embody these souls in new bodies...

![Necromantic](images/R63C10.avif)

### Darkness

Darkness. No, not evil, not curses, not black paint, you foolish mortal! Darkness! It's not the absence of light, as your scientists thought before, it's darkness! Very, very dark and... Well... Inexplicable. I also don't know what this magic does! From the outside, it's just poof! - it's dark and all enemies are dead! Well... when dragons do it. Maybe this will help you hide in the shadows? You will have to explore these possibilities yourself, but if this is your element, it shouldn't be a big problem, you will understand it instinctively. Probably.

![Darkness](images/R63C11.avif)

### Nights Beast

In the dark, you will be much, much stronger than usual. So as soon as the sun touches the horizon, all your enemies better start hiding! All your senses will be enhanced, your body will become tougher, faster, and all that, because the darkness around you will continuously fill you with energy! Where does the energy come from in the darkness? Who knows?! In any case, just wrapping yourself in a cloak won't help - there needs to be a lot of darkness. A large, spacious cave is the minimum you will feel, because at night in the sky you will see darkness that stretches for entire parsecs!

![Nights Beast](images/R63C12.avif)

### Water

Water is a very convenient element and you can do a lot with it! Summon rain to please farmers and escape the summer heat, drown an enemy, purify water making it crystal clear and tasty, drown even more enemies, wash something, and even drown an enemy. Or an entire country, causing a flood! Wipe out entire cities with a giant, all-destroying tsunami! Or drown an enemy, right. No, suck out all the blood to desiccate, that's impossible, because blood contains a lot of life energy and that's a different element.

![Water](images/R63C13.avif)

### Aquatic Adaptation

Okay, okay, I'm joking. Actually, water magic is not that boring. If you learn to use it, you can even breathe underwater, use it for protection, or even cut things by directing water at the target under high pressure. Separate liquids, extracting all the components from a complex secret potion, and even literally lie on clouds. Water will become your element in every sense, and at the bottom of the sea, you will feel as comfortable as at home.

![Aquatic Adaptation](images/R63C14.avif)

### Lightning

Zzap! Bzzzt! Thunder and lightning! The fastest, sharpest, and loudest element is now in your hands! It's impossible to run or dodge these swift bolts! One day you yourself will become just as unimaginably fast, but for the first few thousand years, you will just shoot lightning from your hands, which is also very fun! By concentrating, you can even generate stable 220 volts and feel what electricity does inside any device.

![Lightning](images/R63C15.avif)

### Celestial

The element of lightning will give you a special, bright, and sparkling aura that will make people think you are a holy innocent maiden! Even the living dead will panic and run away from you! In the past, even 10% of this would have been enough to create a new religion, but now the world has much more magic... But still, people will treat you with much more reverence and worship! But some will rape you with much more pleasure, enjoying the desecration...

![Celestial](images/R63C16.avif)

### Venomous

Poisons are an incredibly complex and dangerous element, so be especially careful, especially in the first years. Because some poisons have very dangerous long-term effects that are easy to overlook and almost impossible to cure! What if you accidentally poison yourself so that you die in a hundred years? Hey, stop thinking that this will never happen and you won't live that long anyway! Now you are a half-dragon! And you need to take care of your health, because you can live damn long, and coughing for thousands of years because of some stupid poison is definitely not something you want! Oh, but wait, when you master the element, you will be able to neutralize the poison!

![Venomous](images/R63C17.avif)

### Aphrodisiac

It seems you are particularly good at lustful poisons. You can create an aphrodisiac for a specific person, literally driving them mad with lust, or just slightly arousing them so they don't suspect anything. You feel all this instinctively, so just think of mischief, hold your breath for a couple of seconds, and exhale this sweet poison. You can even make it affect only a specific target! Or only young girls who will become much hotter and lustful! And then "poison" an entire city! Well... If you have enough mana.

![Aphrodisiac](images/R63C18.avif)

### Wild Magic

This is a very rare gift - to sense not elements, but pure wild magic. It is incredibly difficult to control, and working with it resembles a psychedelic trip that can easily drive you mad. In any case, you won't achieve anything by force here, so unlike other elements, you will usually need to follow the magic, let it guide you. But you will be able to change the very foundation of the surrounding world. Time, space, arcana. This is such a rare, strong, and valuable gift that if you don't go mad in the first years, even great dragons will treat you with a certain respect.

![Wild Magic](images/R63C19.avif)

### Distortions

There are no words to describe this in any language. Even among dragons. All descriptions are confused and vague, as if a sighted person is trying to explain the beauty of a rainbow to a blind worm. But it is this... element? Or something else entirely that allows you to create magic over magic. I think it's enough to say that it is precisely the dragons possessing this gift who opened the passage to your world and there are only a few of them. It is practically impossible to control and easy to distort yourself or even the rules of an entire world, but if you master this, you will be compared to lesser gods.

![Distortions](images/R63C20.avif)

## Features



## 



### Robust

Your body may still seem soft and supple, but you are incredibly tough and resilient. Your delicate skin is hard to scratch even with a knife,  and being hit with fists or even clubs feels like a relaxing massage!

![Robust](images/R65C1.avif)

### Strong

You are superhumanly strong. Lifting a couple of tons is like carrying a few grocery bags for you! Ever dreamed of fighting with an enormous sword that a regular person couldn't even lift? I have great news for you, because your tail helps maintain balance when swinging heavy weapons!

![Strong](images/R65C2.avif)

### Agile 

You are very agile, nimble, and quick. Even snakes hiss in envy when they see how you can bend! Climbing walls, jumping, and fighting upside down is as easy for you as kissing your own ass.

![Agile ](images/R65C3.avif)

### Fireproof

You are practically invulnerable to fire and your element. Why would they harm their mistress? On the contrary, they only energize you! Ah, baths in molten gold are the best! It's a bit of a shame that you probably can't invite friends... But no, this gold is only for you!

![Fireproof](images/R65C4.avif)

### Gold Power

The more gold in your treasure trove, the stronger you become. It's like a mana storage that you can access from anywhere as long as it's not stolen! Did you think dragons collect this metal for no reason? Ha! Just a few dozen tons and you'll surpass any archmage!

![Gold Power](images/R65C5.avif)

### Effortless Flight

No matter what kind of wings you have, magic will easily keep you aloft, and flying will be as simple as walking. Even easier. So often, when you're out with friends or doing something else enjoyable, you just tuck your legs up to give them a rest.

![Effortless Flight](images/R65C6.avif)

### Dive Attack

The favorite attack of all dragons is a swift dive from the skies and a sudden powerful strike with claws or flame! Often, the prey doesn't even realize it's being attacked! Oh, well... In your case, it will be more convenient to use a spear or some large sword. And make sure they're the sturdiest, so they don't break!

![Dive Attack](images/R65C7.avif)

### Supersonic

Even with such a small and weak body, you can fly incredibly fast, even faster than the speed of sound! Don't worry about a random bug hitting your eye - magic will protect you so well that even your hairstyle won't be ruined!  

![Supersonic](images/R65C8.avif)

### Space

Oh, no, I'm telling you - dragons mainly use magic to fly, flapping wings like a bird is actually very difficult. So you can easily fly into space, magic will protect you. It's quite beautiful there, but damn empty, so usually, no one bothers with it. But if you're curious - give it a try!

![Space](images/R65C9.avif)

### Cosmic Speed

One of the features of dragon flight in space is that, unlike a rocket, you can flap your wings as much as you want, gradually accelerating and accelerating... This way, you can reach enormous speeds, as nothing slows you down! The journey to Mars will take only a couple of days if you really try!

![Cosmic Speed](images/R65C10.avif)

### Enhanced Vision

Your vision has become much sharper than a human's, so tracking prey while soaring in the sky or reading a newspaper from several hundred meters away won't be a problem for you. Even at night! By the way, now your eyes glow beautifully in the dark like a cat's!

![Enhanced Vision](images/R65C11.avif)

### Spectral

Now you can see a much wider range of light waves. Ultraviolet, infrared light, and all that. You can see heat and even enjoy the sight of naked bodies right through clothing!

![Spectral](images/R65C12.avif)

### X-ray

Now you see the world almost like a real dragon! So you can see even through thick walls! At first, it's confusing, but soon you'll learn to separate your perception so you don't see people as a bunch of meat and internal organs. Probably.

![X-ray](images/R65C13.avif)

### Pack Leader

You have great blood and are much stronger, so all other half-dragons will instinctively recognize you as the leader of the pack. Just don't offend them and occasionally pet their heads, and they will be loyal to you like no one else.

![Pack Leader](images/R65C14.avif)

### Natural Ruler

You have all the makings of a truly great ruler. Just place your soft butt on a throne, and you'll be able to govern a country brilliantly. Or a small gang. Or a pack. But it's still better to make a throne.

![Natural Ruler](images/R65C15.avif)

### Dance Master

You dance magnificently and especially enjoy complex dances that require you to use your entire body. Erotic pole dancing is perfect for this, so you often do it! What? Of course, this is essential for combat skills, it trains your body!

![Dance Master](images/R65C16.avif)

### Combat Grace

After you learn to elegantly spread your legs in a jump, dodging an attack from some big guy will be a breeze! Just don't wear heavy armor, and you'll be able to literally dance in battle, dodging anything and taunting your enemies with your butt!

![Combat Grace](images/R65C17.avif)

### Blade Mastery

You might not know how to fight properly, but you can swing sharp blades so fast that your enemies will think you have six arms! Who cares if your attacks are simple if you can strike 10 times a second from different directions?

![Blade Mastery](images/R65C18.avif)

### Combat Acrobatics

Amazing combat acrobatics, speed, and strength... If you combine these skills with an instinctive understanding of your opponent's actions and accelerated learning in combat, you will become a great warrior! And remember - all great heroines fight in panties for speed and to distract enemies!

![Combat Acrobatics](images/R65C19.avif)

### Stealthy

Usually, dragons don't like to hide, but it seems you can sense others' attention, so you can quickly learn to conceal yourself. Silent infiltrations, backstabbing, all that. Just don't forget to hide your horns, so their magnificence doesn't attract the enemy's gaze!

![Stealthy](images/R65C20.avif)

### Retreat

When there are too many enemies, it's not shameful to run away! After all, you can find them all later and take your revenge, right? And you'll be absolutely amazing at it! Able to escape any trap, evade any pursuit - you'll have no equal! Except maybe those damn witches...

![Retreat](images/R65C21.avif)

### Regeneration

Oh yes, you still have your incredible regeneration. Of course, it's better not to end up buried under ruins again, but just don't anger the dragons and everything will be fine. And you don't need to worry about minor things like a couple of arrows or a sword piercing you - it will heal in a minute.

![Regeneration](images/R65C22.avif)

### Impressive Scars

For some reason, your body always leaves a few scars, usually choosing the most beautiful and impressive ones. This doesn't affect your health, but you'll look much more dangerous and experienced. And when you get a new cool wound, the old scar will heal instantly.

![Impressive Scars](images/R65C23.avif)

### Protective Scales

If you receive a dangerous wound, your body, as if fearing new injuries, will cover the vulnerable spot with strong, tough scales. So you definitely won't be hurt there again! Sometimes it looks a bit strange... But in any case, these scales will shed during your next molt in about a month.

![Protective Scales](images/R65C24.avif)

### Dragon's Call

You can emit a special call for help that dragons will hear even a thousand kilometers away. Of course, most of them won't care if you're not from their pack, but there will always be some young dragon who will come just to enjoy the battle and the hot sex afterward.

![Dragon's Call](images/R65C25.avif)

### Venomous Saliva

You can produce venom and acids in your saliva. If you concentrate and spend mana, you can even melt handcuffs with a spit, but it's difficult and dangerous. It's much easier to just produce a little aphrodisiac or light drugs! Or something like pepper extract, so the dick or pussy you lick will burn with desire!

![Venomous Saliva](images/R65C26.avif)

### Healing Licks

Yes, you can make useful potions... It's enough for you to just lick someone's wound and it will heal perfectly. And to cure a disease, you'll need to kiss for a long time, but the most effective way is to swallow deep and thoroughly - the medicine will work much faster! And it's so much more enjoyable! Ha, just don't become addicted to it!

![Healing Licks](images/R65C27.avif)

### Alchemist

I think you'll soon become famous as one of the greatest alchemists of your era. At least, definitely the best in your city! Ha, I mean, it's very easy to be a great alchemist when you can analyze the composition of any potion by taste, and to replicate it, you just need to spit into a jar, right? Just make sure to eat plenty of vitamins!

![Alchemist](images/R65C28.avif)

### Fire Spirits

Probably because you're so small, your fire elemental is also special. Small. You're probably the only one in the world who can summon not huge, furious fire spirits, but small, cute, and very obedient fire girls! Of course, they can also start a fire, but they can easily live in a fireplace if there's enough fuel.

![Fire Spirits](images/R65C29.avif)

### Skill Book

You have a very strange ability, I don't even know how to describe it... If you find a handwritten book that describes some skill in detail, you can master it completely in just a minute, but the book will be ruined. A skill book? Like in games? Wait, what are you talking about? Did people really do that in the past?

![Skill Book](images/R65C30.avif)

### Cantrips

You instinctively sense magic, so you can cast simple spells even without training. You don't even need to say spells or prepare in any way. Just point your finger and a small magic arrow will fly at the enemy! Ha, actually, you don't even need to move your finger, but that's only for the simplest spells or those you use frequently.

![Cantrips](images/R65C31.avif)

### Arcane Gift

Magic comes much, much easier to dragons than to humans. You see, feel it, and can always predict how even an unfamiliar spell will behave, plus you can control it directly, without using silly rituals. Of course, you won't find a suitable teacher for yourself and you'll have to invent everything yourself, but you'll definitely manage!

![Arcane Gift](images/R65C32.avif)

### Rune Magic

These runes were invented by demons, it's strange that humans know even a few of them... They allow you to direct mana flows completely autonomously and are perfect for traps that need to work for years and complex spells that are too lazy to repeat each time. You'll feel how it works, so you can compose spells yourself, just first peek at the runes themselves.

![Rune Magic](images/R65C33.avif)

### Portal Mastery

Portals are one of the greatest spells, mastered by only a few. It requires a special gift, a sense of direction in other dimensions, and something else. And if you possess all of this, if you succeed... Even great dragons will sometimes ask you to create a few holes in space for them. And set even more traps in their treasure vaults specifically against you.

![Portal Mastery](images/R65C34.avif)

### Time Peek

An incredible and useless ability... You'll be able to look 10 minutes into the future. You'll really see how events would unfold! But as soon as you do, the future will instantly change, and you'll see a new version, how you would act with this new knowledge. And a moment later - with knowledge about the knowledge... And so on to infinity! Usually, people lose consciousness from this, but maybe you can come up with something.

![Time Peek](images/R65C35.avif)

### Ideal  Form

Your body will always maintain its ideal form. That is, exactly the form you consider the most beautiful, the most comfortable, and the most fitting for you. So if your preferences change slightly over a few years, your butt will immediately become even bigger and softer! And bigger! A huge hyper-butt will be with you as long as your tastes don't change again!

![Ideal  Form](images/R65C36.avif)

### Infinite Growth

You're lucky to have inherited from the dragon not just strength and scales, but the most important trait - the ability to evolve further. You never lose your skills and never grow weaker. With each day, with each small effort, you become stronger, accumulating power and knowledge. Step by step, over hundreds and thousands of years, you will become truly great. Truly equal to them.

![Infinite Growth](images/R65C37.avif)

### Secret Egg

This secret technique allows you to enchant one of your eggs so that if you die, your soul will be reborn in it. Even the body will be exactly the same, and you will retain all your memories! Usually, it is hidden in the safest possible place, and then you erase your own memories of it.  Why? Uh... well... life happens...

![Secret Egg](images/R65C38.avif)

### Multiple Bodies

Oh yes, the magic of change is capable of very strange things... You can create a second body for yourself that you will feel just as much as the first. Perhaps when you get used to this crazy feeling, you'll create a third! And if one of the bodies is killed, you won't lose anything and your soul will be fine as long as not all copies are dead.

![Multiple Bodies](images/R65C39.avif)

### First Shoot

When you're hungry, you have very poor self-control and just to get some tasty, quick energy, you slightly alter the body of the nearest girl, making her a futanari. After all, the first orgasm is as energizing as a hundred ordinary ones. They've never come like this before, and these balls have been storing energy for years!

![First Shoot](images/R65C40.avif)

### Real Queen

A true queen is the girl who gives birth to the future king, right? The one who is fucked by the current king? It's all very simple - to become the legitimate queen, you must make the king fuck you! So when you conquer lands, you just need to publicly accept the king's cock, and everyone will immediately recognize you as the rightful ruler! And if you force him, no one will doubt who's in charge and whose orders to follow!

![Real Queen](images/R65C41.avif)

### Enthusiastic Slave

If you are ever enslaved, brainwashed, cursed, or made a slave in any other way, you will serve your new master with special zeal. You will do everything to make him as pleased as possible! Even if it means tying him up and pleasuring him around the clock! After all, that's how he'll get the most pleasure from your body! Soon, anyone will  beg for mercy and trying to let you go, but you will kindly gag them up, wanting to stay with them longer!

![Enthusiastic Slave](images/R65C42.avif)

### Tight Grip

This very simple trick will allow you to use any cock as long as you want! You just need to wrap the base of it with the tip of your tail, and the guy won't be able to come, and the cock will remain pleasantly hard! You can ride it for hours, and if you're in a playful mood today, you won't let the poor guy come at all! Oh, usually in the end, they will promise any money and reveal the most terrible secrets, just so you loosen your grip!

![Tight Grip](images/R65C43.avif)

### Instinctual Acceptance

Dragon semen is so full of life-giving energy, so beneficial and nourishing, that everyone feels it on an instinctual level. So if you just take out your cock and tell any girl that you want to come on her face, her body will immediately obediently freeze, ready to accept this treasure. She might even open her mouth! Later, she won't understand why she did it, but she will still feel grateful for the reward!

![Instinctual Acceptance](images/R65C44.avif)

### Descendants

No girl will ever dare to get rid of your child. Either she will sincerely love him, or if you raped her, she will suddenly develop a very strange kink - the mere thought that she is carrying the child of her rapist will arouse her like nothing else. She will devote her life to him, enjoying the insane feeling of self-degradation and masturbating every night to the memories of how you fucked her and how much she hates you.

![Descendants](images/R65C45.avif)

### Easy Control

Of course, you are a big and strong half-dragon and can handle your victim yourself, but some girls are just too stubborn... If you don't want to break them, just grab them by the hair, and they will immediately freeze, like a cat that has been grabbed by the scruff of its neck. Done! You can fuck them however you want, and they will obediently accept everything, just cursing through their teeth!

![Easy Control](images/R65C46.avif)

### Mercy

Dragons are the true rulers of this world, and ordinary people have long accepted that if a dragon does not kill a girl, it is a great mercy. Now this applies to you too! No matter how brutally you rape, beat, or humiliate her - if you release your victim within a week and do not maim her, everyone around will only thank you for your great kindness, including her and her parents.

![Mercy](images/R65C47.avif)

### Anonymous Evil

To remain anonymous, simply wear any mask, and people around you won't recognize you. Even if your distinctive boobs are still visible. Even if you're wagging your tail and flapping your wings. Just... Just as you're wearing a mask, you're someone completely different! No one will question how this is possible or where the villain disappeared to when you take the mask off... and neither should you.

![Anonymous Evil](images/R65C48.avif)

### Consensual Rape

If a girl cum, it's not a rape! Everyone knows that, right? Well, at least that's what the one you fucked will think. It doesn't matter, even if you used potions, alcohol, or just tied her up with vibrators before leaving - circumstances don't count! She may try to resist at first, but as soon as you make her come, the girl will admit that she really wanted it herself!

![Consensual Rape](images/R65C49.avif)

### Normalize

For some reason, everyone perceives any of your lewd antics as something completely natural, like the singing of birds or the sound of the wind. You can fuck right on the main street, but passersby won't pay any more attention to it than if you were just playing with a dog. Although no, dogs are much more interesting and attract more attention.

![Normalize](images/R65C50.avif)

## Curses



## 



### Weak Spot

Because of your human half, you'll have a terrible, noticeable vulnerability that everyone will always target during battles! What? Oh, well... Actually, it's your back, but your butt is also an excellent target! Hah, at least this way you'll be hit less in your vulnerable spot!

![Weak Spot](images/R67C1.avif)

### Torn

Due to your sharp scales or because you're too strong, or because vendors slip you cheap stuff, your clothes will always tear apart within a couple of days. Even the cutest skirt will turn into rags!

![Torn](images/R67C2.avif)

### Panty Problems

Oh, maybe it's a curse... Or are your scales that sharp? Either way, panties won't stay on you, so within half an hour or at most an hour, they'll come undone, rip, and fall off, leaving your pussy completely exposed!

![Panty Problems](images/R67C3.avif)

### Naked

Mmm... yeah, I think you've already figured it out... Well, dragons don't wear clothes either! For them, even mithril chainmail is too fragile! That's the price of great power. Don't despair, at least you didn't go bald like some heroes!

![Naked](images/R67C4.avif)

### Stuttering

When you get nervous, you start to stutter. And when you stutter, you get even more nervous! So sometimes it will be incredibly hard for you to explain yourself with words, especially during the most nerve-wracking moments. So if you're confessing your love, it's better to just lift your tail!

![Stuttering](images/R67C5.avif)

### High Heels

It seems your legs haven't fully transformed... I mean, you don't have powerful claws here, but your foot has changed, so now it's very uncomfortable to walk without high heels. Don't worry, you'll get used to it quickly! Surely, your enemies will tremble in fear hearing the clicking of your heels!

![High Heels](images/R67C6.avif)

### Best Gear Only

The main thing is strength! Or armor! Or magical aura! You don't care how the armor or clothes look, even if they're a bit cursed, but if they have the best stats, you'll definitely choose them! And if that piercing or butt plug adds magical enhancement... Well, you can't help it, you'll have to wear it!

![Best Gear Only](images/R67C7.avif)

### Need for a Master

It doesn't matter how strong or proud you are, you simply need a master. Or a mistress! You'll never be able to use all your abilities to 100% without feeling the collar, without feeling that you're being controlled and guided! But for the protection of your beloved master, you're ready to give 200%!

![Need for a Master](images/R67C8.avif)

### Monster Bait

You're damn tough, so surely nothing will happen to you, right? At least that's what your companions will always think when they need bait for monsters. Oh, and of course, they won't rush! I mean, all the monsters need to gather together, so you'll have to endure a bit!

![Monster Bait](images/R67C9.avif)

### Time for Babies

Hey, girl! You're already over a thousand years old! The clock is ticking, it's high time you had children! At least all your instincts will be screaming that, so for any dragon, you'll just be a bitch in heat who will present her cunt to be filled with cum!! For anyone who even resembles a dragon! Who has even a drop of their power!

![Time for Babies](images/R67C10.avif)

### Old-School

In a world filled with fantasy, magic, and monsters, you just can't trust those weird things! Your choice is firearms and comfortable tactical gear! Let everyone look at you like you're a weirdo, but you're sure that a good old revolver is much more reliable than any magical wand!

![Old-School](images/R67C11.avif)

### Warm-Up

Fights are great, but what's the fun if you win with the first blow? So for the first few minutes, you'll just warm up, fighting at half strength. But the stronger the enemy, the more damage they manage to inflict, the more ferociously you'll fight afterward!

![Warm-Up](images/R67C12.avif)

### Hardcore

For some reason, everyone thinks that being gentle with you is an insult to all dragons. I mean, you're fierce warriors, right? So you should be fucked as brutally and ferociously as possible! No matter how much you beg for mercy, everyone will think it's just a game, and even your lover will always bite your clit so hard you'll think he's going to bite it off!

![Hardcore](images/R67C13.avif)

### Lewd Vows

If you lose to anyone, after they've had their fun with you, they'll also make you take some kind of lewd vow for a couple of months.  Stretching your anus every day, kissing every passerby, dreaming only of their dick when you masturbate or something else fun!

![Lewd Vows](images/R67C14.avif)

### Maso

Oh, maybe you should just admit that you're a perverted masochist, and you like being beaten and humiliated? Raped, forced to dress like a whore, and take cock after cock? Wait, I didn't miss anything? Oh, that's right, now any pain is a pleasure for you, dirty pervert!

![Maso](images/R67C15.avif)

### Drug Addicted

When you're an alchemist and can get, buy, or make any drug yourself, it's damn hard to resist and not try them, right? Just a couple of doses to have a little fun! Nothing bad will happen, right? Oh, but now you can't stop...

![Drug Addicted](images/R67C16.avif)

### Huge Appetite

Your body requires a lot of energy, so you have to eat much more frequently and in larger quantities than ordinary people! Eating a whole roasted boar is a regular thing for you! For dinner, you can eat even more! Well, at least your body absorbs everything without any waste, and you don't need to run to the toilet!

![Huge Appetite](images/R67C17.avif)

### Extra

Uh... No, you're not fat... well, maybe you did eat too much, but... No, it's not extra fat! It's energy reserves! And besides, you're just big-boned and muscular! And... And besides, big, soft girls are beautiful too!

![Extra](images/R67C18.avif)

### Sauce

Regular food is still lacking something... No matter how many spices you add, it seems so bland, like you're eating cardboard... Oh, right! Cum! Life-giving juices brutally squeezed out of men! With sperm, everything is much better, as if it's the only sauce that makes ordinary food tasty again!

![Sauce](images/R67C19.avif)

### Morning Struggles

Mornings are always the hardest time of day for you. Until you drink at least a couple of mugs of strong coffee, even the simplest spells will go awry, and your head will be in a fog. Well, at least at night you have plenty of energy! So you fall asleep long-long after midnight...

![Morning Struggles](images/R67C20.avif)

### Bad Luck

You often have bad luck with some completely ridiculous little things. This hardly affects your life and power, but it ruins your mood and doesn't let you relax for a second.

![Bad Luck](images/R67C21.avif)

### Clumsy

No matter how agile and trained you are, for some reason, you always drop things... and trying to catch them usually makes it worse! So it's better not to buy ceramic mugs, they won't last more than a couple of days anyway!

![Clumsy](images/R67C22.avif)

### Desperate Training

Lust and despair are the only way to train your magical reserves. So you'll have to completely deplete your mana, tie yourself up well in a dangerous area, and then desperately try to free yourself with spells, knowing that you'll be found soon!

![Desperate Training](images/R67C23.avif)

### Bloody Mess

Oops! You don't deal more damage, but for some reason, your battles always end with incredible fountains of blood. It's amazing that even after this brutal gore show, you can still take the defeated opponent prisoner!

![Bloody Mess](images/R67C24.avif)

### Sensitive Nose

Your sense of smell is much more sensitive than humans', and, perhaps, this should be your advantage, but... Your sensitivity to pheromones has also increased many times! Now you can sense males from hundreds of meters away and literally taste the arousing flavor of their cock!

![Sensitive Nose](images/R67C25.avif)

### Dark Side

It seems you have a second, evil and incredibly cruel, but sweet half! Greedy for power, gold, sex, and blood, it often breaks free, takes control of your body, and begins to crush, burn, and rape everything around it like a true dragon should!

![Dark Side](images/R67C26.avif)

### Protective

Hehe... don't worry, I'll take care of everything~ When you face real danger, just relax and let me destroy all your enemies~ They'll drown in blood, and their cities will be reduced to ashes and smoldering ruins!

![Protective](images/R67C27.avif)

### Dirty Rumors

No matter how you behave and what you do, people will always spread the dirtiest rumors about you. Everyone will be sure that you don't fight monsters, but only fuck them, that your ass can be bought for just a few coins or even paid for by cumming in your throat.

![Dirty Rumors](images/R67C28.avif)

### Mimic Vulnerability

Maybe mimics evolve too quickly... You were sure you could easily spot a fake new chest among the ruins, but now they can disguise themselves as just a wall or floor! Or maybe it's some curse... Either way, now they'll catch you much more often.

![Mimic Vulnerability](images/R67C29.avif)

### Human Compassion

Your stupid human half still struggles to prove that you're not a monster. And in battle, your body refuses to harm people. You just freeze, allowing them to do whatever they want with you, instead of tearing them apart or burning them in fire!

![Human Compassion](images/R67C30.avif)

### Free Fuck

Um... It seems it's not about your love for people, because you just can't resist sexual violence. Even if some knight comes to your cave to challenge you to a fight, he can just order you to present your ass and fuck you thoroughly before you start fighting.

![Free Fuck](images/R67C31.avif)

### Energy Sharing

Your powerful body is so full of energy that it readily shares it with all your sexual partners, whether you like it or not. Now anyone who sticks their cock in you will become just as strong and tireless and can fuck you for many hours!

![Energy Sharing](images/R67C32.avif)

### Ticklish

You are incredibly afraid of being tickled. You don't just laugh or try to escape when someone tickles you, no, you become completely unable to resist and will willingly surrender to a monster, just so those tentacles don't tickle you while trying to grab you!

![Ticklish](images/R67C33.avif)

### Evil Spirits

You are haunted by evil spirits. They don't harm you directly, but everyone around you will be plagued by misfortune, and things will often go missing. However, this can be used as a weapon, because if you spend several months in seclusion before an important battle, the spirits will get bored and almost certainly attack your enemies.

![Evil Spirits](images/R67C34.avif)

### Dark Gods' Attention

You feel the attention of dark gods. Beings that dwell between worlds and feed on human suffering... You're almost certain that other dragons also feel this, and that even they left the other world a thousand years ago when it became too dangerous.

![Dark Gods' Attention](images/R67C35.avif)

## Events

### Lawful Lewd

You've spent enough time among humans to fully accept their laws and traditions. You're a very law-abiding person, not a wild monster, right? So this has become your second nature, and now you obey all city laws wherever you go!

![Lawful Lewd](images/R70C1.avif)

### Public Property

Eventually, the townsfolk stopped pretending there were any special laws for you... Screw it - you're just their bitch whom they enjoy humiliating and abusing! So now you're just public meat for fucking, and you get raped from 3 PM to 3 AM! Hah, at least now you know your schedule!

![Public Property](images/R70C2.avif)

### Hooker

Oh, it looks like you didn't find a decent job, but no matter... I mean, prostitution isn't called the oldest profession for nothing! Beautiful bitches like you can always earn a handful of coins by offering your holes to anyone who wants them!

![Hooker](images/R70C3.avif)

### Energy Station

Your energy reserves are truly inexhaustible, and tired travelers or adventurers before a raid are willing to pay well for such a buff! So now you work as a recharging station in the local tavern! Only 10 minutes per guy, but the line is often booked for a couple of hours in advance!

![Energy Station](images/R70C4.avif)

### Mount Energy

In the end, people usually travel on mounts, so their stamina is even more important! Rich merchants are willing to pay a large sum of money to quickly "recharge" a caravan, and if you have to service several dozen horses... No big deal, bitch, you can handle it, right?

![Mount Energy](images/R70C5.avif)

### Princess Training

One spoiled princess really didn't want to leave home and live in the wild lands until she was thoroughly fucked by a dragon... There are no feasts and balls there! It's so boring there! So her parents arranged with you to rape her and fill her with sperm at least three times a day. I mean, you're only a half-dragon, so your sperm is needed much more!

![Princess Training](images/R70C6.avif)

### Aristocratic Service

This service turned out to be surprisingly popular among aristocrats, so soon you gathered a small harem of beauties whose parents paid you huge sums of money, demanding that you discipline and teach them obedience. They are even willing to pay a large bonus if some of your friend dragons join you occasionally!

![Aristocratic Service](images/R70C7.avif)

### Spoiled Bitch

Ugh... Some princesses are damn, impossibly spoiled! And what's worse - their parents are too powerful and influential! So while they dutifully accepted your sperm and juices to gain energy, the rest of the time they tormented you! They rode on you, made you lick their feet, and sleep in a cage like their pet!

![Spoiled Bitch](images/R70C8.avif)

### True Love

It must be one of the strange rules of this world, but within just a couple of weeks, you fell madly in love with each other. Another month you both pretended everything was normal, but then you couldn't take it anymore and ran away. You'll surely find a tower for her where you can be alone, focused only on love! Take it if you must!

![True Love](images/R70C9.avif)

### Slave Catcher

Well-trained slaves are a great commodity, so you seriously got into this business. Every month, you went to the Wild Lands to catch a few quality beauties, and then trained them day after day until they obeyed any command and genuinely loved whoever owned them.

![Slave Catcher](images/R70C10.avif)

### Brothel Business

Hmm... Why give slaves to brothels if you can sell them yourself? You'll surely have the best establishment! You remember the great costumes from your past life and a bunch of kinky stuff that guests will love! Ah, true, at first, you'll probably have to work there yourself to show how everything should be done...

![Brothel Business](images/R70C11.avif)

### Vibrator Reinventing

This world was very fun, but it lacked good vibrators... Magical stones are too expensive and hard, and cheap wooden dildos are just trash! So you spent a ton of time reinventing quality latex and vibrator bullets! Ha, of course, they became insanely popular!

![Vibrator Reinventing](images/R70C12.avif)

### Fairy Fleshlights

You almost forgot about them, but fairies in any hentai are just flying fleshlight... It was a very, very difficult ritual to curse an entire race! But it was worth it, because now the little naughty girls are flexible enough to accept any cock! Ha, they'll thank you when they taste it!

![Fairy Fleshlights](images/R70C13.avif)

### Grooming

You smell almost like one of them, so young dragons often didn't fight with you but chatted about life... And soon it turned out that your small hands are perfect for combing their fur or polishing their scales to a shine! Usually, this is done with magic, but young dragons control their power too poorly!

![Grooming](images/R70C14.avif)

### Manicure

You already have a whole line of familiar dragons! Damn, you can't do grooming day after day! So you need to hire workers! Ah... The main thing is to rub them with your sweat, so their smell doesn't tease the dragons' appetite, and make a suitable tool to sharpen the strong dragon claws...

![Manicure](images/R70C15.avif)

### Explorer

Ancient ruins hold too many treasures, forgotten secrets, technologies, and powerful weapons. So of course, you couldn't resist starting to explore cursed cities, catacombs, and dungeons! There are many terrifying monsters and traps here, but that only makes the adventures more fun and the loot more valuable!

![Explorer](images/R70C16.avif)

### Space Base

In one of the secret NASA bunkers, you discovered records of a space base on Mars' orbit... It turns out they secretly built it for many years! And it's damn big, before the invasion there were thousands of scientists and technicians there! Hmm... Maybe they even managed to survive somehow, extracting resources from asteroids? You definitely need to visit them!

![Space Base](images/R70C17.avif)

### Mating

You smell like a very, very good bitch, so one of the dragons became seriously interested in your cunt. No, not just to fuck it a couple of times, but to see if he could impregnate you! It didn't work the first time, but your cycles work differently... Hmm... It's easier to just stick you underneath and cum inside you non-stop, so he definitely won't miss the best moment!

![Mating](images/R70C18.avif)

### Daughters

Ha, just a couple of months on his cock and your womb has finally changed due to the abundance of dragon sperm and energy! You not only laid a huge egg for him, but now will always give birth to cute dragon-girls! A whole new race of convenient living incubators for dragon eggs!

![Daughters](images/R70C19.avif)

### Best Mom

Ah, children are so wonderful! What could be better than little dragonlings and dragon-girls? And hey, to have more dragon-girls, you need to work hard! Fortunately, your strong body can easily handle it, so soon you'll have hundreds of cute daughters, and you'll happily take care of them!

![Best Mom](images/R70C20.avif)

### Adventurer's Life

Treasures, artifacts, monsters, and dungeons - this world seems made for adventurers! Although many of them disappear in the lairs of various lustful creatures, but... Screw it, this risk only adds to the fun! So you became one of the best mercenaries around! Hah, the main thing is not to forget to pay the insurance fee so they don't forget to save you when some cunning monster catches you...

![Adventurer's Life](images/R70C21.avif)

### Conquest

You're almost a dragon, you were created to conquer and subdue! So you decided to capture an entire barony. To avoid killing your future human subjects, you decided to just fuck them until they passed out, and so far, no guard squad has refused such a challenge! You're doing great, but ahead lies a real challenge - a battle with an entire army! It seems the baron even hired orcs and ogres!

![Conquest](images/R70C22.avif)

### Sith Lord

When you found this crimson lightsaber in the loot chest, you immediately knew it was destiny! You mean, of course, crimson suits the color of your scales better! And the Sith always valued strength, just like you! And most importantly - they have great costumes! You would never wear the silly robes of the Jedi, so it's decided! Now you just need to find an empire to conquer...

![Sith Lord](images/R70C23.avif)

### Human Disguise

Over time, you came up with many ways to disguise yourself and finally managed to live like a normal person. Although hiding wings under clothes is terribly uncomfortable, and a tail between your legs makes it hard to walk, but... it's still nice to feel like an ordinary girl! Just sit in a cafe, wink at guys who don't try to fuck you as soon as they see you...

![Human Disguise](images/R70C24.avif)

### Mecha

Damn, where did the cyber witch even get this battle robot? In your time, there definitely weren't such giants! Fortunately, this fool rushed and attacked the city without even figuring out the weaponry or how to close the armor cabin, so it all ended in a ridiculous catfight when you reached the pilot... Ugh... Now you have your own mech, but how do you charge its batteries?

![Mecha](images/R70C25.avif)

### New Horizons

You've spent enough time in these places. Wild Lands, Mistressia, Lordshold... it's pretty fun here, and you have many acquaintances, but your thirst for exploration and adventure knows no bounds! So when a caravan of huge, heavily armored machines arrived, you immediately hired yourself as a guard, dreaming of visiting distant lands and seeing new people!

![New Horizons](images/R70C26.avif)

### Dragon Brothel

When your fans found out you knew dragons, they literally begged you to arrange a meeting with them. Day after day they followed you and even offered money until you gave in... Okay! You'll take money from them for the opportunity to enjoy dragon cocks - and from the dragons for a steady supply of fresh bitches they can tear apart!

![Dragon Brothel](images/R70C27.avif)

### Dragon Hunt

Well, when a couple of familiar dragons said they would also gladly offer their asses to brave knights, you weren't even surprised... You mean, it was the dragons who cast those hentai curses, of course, there are perverts among them too! And it seems you are the perfect intermediary, who now arranges a "dragon hunt" where a dozen knights try to fuck these perverts...

![Dragon Hunt](images/R70C28.avif)

### Dragon Slayer

Perhaps hundreds of years have passed, but your battle is not over! You will protect humanity, dragons must be defeated! You even managed to defeat and drive away a couple! Hah... The smallest and youngest... In any case, territorial battles are common among the youth, so while people admire your courage, none of the great dragons even notice your antics.

![Dragon Slayer](images/R70C29.avif)

### Great One

You've always been curious about what kind of drugs these strange nuns use and why they're always so happy, so you decide to take part in their ritual. Just once, just to try it out! Aaah! Your pussy may be tearing on a meat monolith, but these orgasms, they're divine pleasure! Now you know for sure that life without the love of the Great One is meaningless!

![Great One](images/R70C30.avif)

### Strongest Duo

Once you sensed a very familiar, very frightening smell... That's how you smell, your blood... That dragon you wounded hundreds of years ago! You were already preparing for battle, ready to fight again, but you were knocked down by a young, but still insanely strong dragon who began to happily lick you! This... This is your... Brother? For some reason, you immediately understood that together you can defeat anyone and hugged him in response!

![Strongest Duo](images/R70C31.avif)

### Kindergarten

Some dragons are born incredibly small! The size of a cat, these little ones can't even talk yet and are terribly bored because they can't play with their giant parents! So you decided to take care of them and managed to settle them in the city! At least people are more suitable in size and easier to play with! And great magic won't let people even scratch them! After all, their mommy often circles in the sky looking out for them!

![Kindergarten](images/R70C32.avif)

### Bank

Gold, gold... From your past life, you definitely knew who had the most money - the bankers! So, using the treasures found in your adventures, you opened your own bank! Of course, it's terribly unpleasant to have to give something away sometimes, but now you can sleep every night on a huge, cozy pile of gold, guarding it!

![Bank](images/R70C33.avif)

### Bimbo Curse

Oops! It seems your lust for powerful artifacts has betrayed you! Because the curse on this magic-filled collar turned out to be damn strong! Now your entire body is 10 times more sensitive to the clitoris, you come 2 times a second, and can only think about cocks! You can only remove it by tearing it with a cock in your throat, and if you don't get rid of it within a month, you'll forever become a pink bimbo-dragon!

![Bimbo Curse](images/R70C34.avif)

### Dragon Girl Pack

In one year, you have managed to gather a dozen half-dragons who fully recognize your leadership of the pack. Well... usually... If you roar really loud... Anyway, living with these bitches became a lot more fun, so much so that your whole life turned into a kind of lewd sitcom! And in the second season, you even managed to defeat a luckless dragon, so now your pack has its own territory!

![Dragon Girl Pack](images/R70C35.avif)

## Epilogue



## 



### Fashion Icon

Always cheerful, fun, and beautiful, you were always the center of attention. And while initially, it was mostly guys who fucked you, soon your wild and vibrant turbo-slut style became incredibly popular among girls too! Because you seduced all the guys, and the girls who also wanted to have fun had to become much more promiscuous, accessible, and flashy! Just like you! So soon, you became a true fashion icon, as everyone wanted the same ripped stockings as you! The same panties, the same vibrators! Ha, they even started wearing fake tails, and fake bright scales became a sure sign that a girl could be fucked without even asking!

![Fashion Icon](images/R72C1.avif)

### Royal Concubine

Having a real half-dragon as a concubine turned out to be incredibly prestigious, so kings and emperors desperately fought for the right to sit on the throne with their cock in your pussy. They offered incredible sums of money, the best conditions, and artifacts just to spend a couple of days a week with you and be able to show off your ass to their subjects. Over time, this became a sacred tradition, and you were even passed down as an inheritance, and the coronation of a young emperor was not considered complete unless he fucked you in the ass in front of everyone. Of course, you could always whisper a few pieces of advice to the ruler and did so for many years, secretly and quietly ruling the most powerful human empire.

![Royal Concubine](images/R72C2.avif)

### Brainwashed

Ha, you were too willful to be just a piece of meat for fucking! Why do you even need all those smart thoughts if you're just supposed to suck cocks and serve your master, caring only about his pleasure? Well, at least that's what your Master decided before completely brainwashing you! Ah? How did he catch you? Who is he? Where are you? Forget it, now all those silly questions don't matter! Because you're a good slave, and good slaves just obey and serve their master, whoever he may be! All your holes, your body, your soul, and your mind belong to him! You live only for his pleasure!

![Brainwashed](images/R72C3.avif)

### Captive Goddess

A pack of kobolds somehow got their hands on a powerful drug and managed to kidnap you. Now you live in their secret caves like a goddess! Although the kobolds won't let you go, they serve you and willingly fulfill any of your whims! Anything except freedom, canceling the drug that robs you of your strength and controls your mind, and stopping their great plan to improve the kobold race! Because you have dragon blood, but you're half-human, and they can mate with you! And they love you so much that they do it practically non-stop! Day after day, year after year... Your own offspring will mate with you for centuries until all kobolds become worthy dragon-girls like you!

![Captive Goddess](images/R72C4.avif)

### Fuck Meat

Immortal, almost invulnerable, and ready to serve anyone, accept any cock, and enjoy any humiliation, you became a true legend of this world. No one considers you human anymore, just a sex object, just a sexual body that can be raped, a pair of tits that can be groped, a pussy that can be fucked, and a womb that needs to be impregnated... Your morals, your values, your dreams... all that doesn't matter anymore. You're just used by man after man. They leave you exhausted, bruised, breathless, and dripping with cum. It's a spiral of carnal passion where there is no love, only pain and humiliation... And you gave in to it long ago, forgetting that there could be another life.

![Fuck Meat](images/R72C5.avif)

### Seedbed

When you first got caught by tentacles, you were scared, but you were saved, so you thought it was a normal thing... I mean, many girls get caught by them, it's not that bad, many even go there to relax for a couple of days... But your energy made your tentacle offspring much stronger. And when they grew up, they became a real threat to girls! They caught them by the hundreds, but they especially hunted for you! And... Your offspring became even stronger... And stronger... And stronger... Within a few years, they became real monsters, so no one even tried to save the captured girls anymore! And you, as their favorite seedbed, were forever in their power, hidden deep underground and giving birth to monster after monster...

![Seedbed](images/R72C6.avif)

### End of Life

Although you were a great heroine and all that, the thought of being defeated and raped by the weakest of monsters turned you on so much... You secretly masturbated to this for many years, several times you even gave in, but... Damn, it was never enough! You were too strong! So you invented a way to transfer your power to them! It was the most exciting day of your life, because... because you gave them all the control, all your power, and became a mere piece of meat for fucking! Just like an ordinary mortal girl! Ah, those orgasms from their dirty cocks were the best in your life! But... you were raped again and again, you even gave birth to several goblins before you realized what you had done! Your life will end in these filthy caves and there's nothing you can do about it!

![End of Life](images/R72C7.avif)

### Live Art

You are incredibly beautiful, a true work of art! When you were captured by some old king, you were sure it would end as usual - with hot, fun sex, playing the slave and Master... I mean, otherwise why would you give in to his soldiers? You obediently let them undress you and chain you up, enjoying this game. Even when they secured you to the wall, you just wagged your tail in anticipation, but... Damn! The king turned out to be impotent! He just hung you up like a painting to enjoy your beauty! And, damn, he forbade anyone to even touch you!! AAAW!!! You desperately shook your ass and moaned into the gag, wanting to be fucked, because damn, your juices would have cured his weakness! But... It was the most horrible year in captivity during which you were not allowed to come even once!

![Live Art](images/R72C8.avif)

### Magic

Witches learned to do many extraordinary things by summoning monsters and paying for their services with their hot bodies. Overall, everyone was satisfied, but you always felt sorry for the ordinary people who weren't ready to fuck monsters for years just to learn magic... So you decided to take pity on them and teach mortals the simplest and most basic spells! I mean, their magical reserves would never be enough for great spells, so there's nothing to worry about, right? This won't harm you, and they won't destroy the entire planet in a magical war, right?

![Magic](images/R72C9.avif)

### Bakery

Adventures, dangers, lust, passion, endless sex, humiliation, monsters, treasures... It's all damn fun, but... Maybe you're just tired of it... "Burnt out" haha! Oh, no, of course, your flame is still with you, you just decided to live a few years as an ordinary girl. You opened your own little bakery, where each bun was especially delicious because you used your dragon fire! Ah, this peaceful, quiet life turned out to be surprisingly cozy, so you spent many years just chatting with visitors, playing with kittens, and looking with sweet nostalgia at the whores and adventurers running through the streets. Someday you'll come back!

![Bakery](images/R72C10.avif)

### Fake Lord

Although the townspeople fucked you day after day, when a young dragon tried to take over the city, they barely managed to repel the first attack and quickly figured out what to do. They built a sinister palace for you, brought all the gold in the city to your treasure room, and when the dragon appeared again, everyone pretended that you had already taken over the city! A great and powerful half-dragon that everyone here fears! For a whole week, you deliberately punished everyone and had fun with your new dragon friends, allowing them to fuck the townspeople, but as soon as they flew away, the townspeople immediately started raping you with redoubled force, making up for all their humiliations! Ah! And you'll have to repeat this every few months!

![Fake Lord](images/R72C11.avif)

### Tech Renaissance

You remembered the ancient times too well. Shining cities, millions of machines, computers, robots, mobile phones, the internet! It was so great that you started reviving ancient technologies! You gathered the best scientists, told them everything you remembered yourself, obtained ancient books, made a secret underground laboratory, and within a few years, your group was able to make a simple pistol or engine, and soon they started working on advanced technologies! Ah, when you made your first chip, it was so exciting! Oh, no, of course, you won't arm armies and threaten dragons - that's useless! You just miss the internet and raunchy forums too much!

![Tech Renaissance](images/R72C12.avif)

### Futa Revolution

Your research in alchemy, magic, and human alteration turned out to be incredibly in demand in Mistressia! Especially one of your inventions that completely changed this city... Futa potion! Now every Mistress can grow a huge, powerful cock at any moment! And, damn, they do it every day, completely forgetting about strap-ons and other toys! Now the streets are literally filled around the clock with the screams and moans of guys whose asses are being ripped apart by these huge dicks! And they're already asking you to make a potion with a permanent effect to start a real futa revolution and fuck all the guys in the world!

![Futa Revolution](images/R72C13.avif)

### Sissy Maker

Your venom, semen, or saliva breaks the will of your victims so quickly that you were assigned a special role in the city! Now you have to fuck every guy that the Mistresses catch a few times to quickly break their will and make them obedient sex toys! Sometimes they even bring you tied-up hunks from Lordshold or defeated heroes! Ah! You don't have any days off, but fucking these virgin asses is so pleasant! And seeing proud guys break and how pathetic sissies beg their mistress to fuck them in the ass as hard as possible to bruise their prostate - even more so!

![Sissy Maker](images/R72C14.avif)

### Succubus Friendship

You surprisingly quickly befriended a high succubus... As if you had once met someone very similar, crazy, fun, and greedy for male cocks... Or maybe you read about someone similar in your past life? Uh... Or maybe you're just too crazy, lustful, and perverted yourself, and that's what allowed you to become friends so quickly... In any case, now you enjoy all the attention of the men in Lordshold together! Ah, ordinary slaves also quickly begin to appreciate this new life, but you two alone serve almost as many cocks as all the other girls in the city, haha!

![Succubus Friendship](images/R72C15.avif)

### Endless Fuck Toy

Hm... you... You were once a great heroine and sorceress and created several of your own clones? How strange... These memories are like a fog, but... No, you won't leave, because it's so much fun here! Where else will you be raped so brutally? Who else will come up with new humiliations and punishments for you every day? No, you said you won't leave! You don't need to be saved! AArrrghh!! Damn, stupid clones! You know all their weaknesses, so together with the guys, you easily captured them to break their will! Ah... seeing yourself being raped from the side is so exciting! Yes... The Master is right... You need to make even more clones, even more meat for fucking...

### Cyber-Witch Hunt

After that incident with the robot, you seriously started hunting cyber-witches. They are phenomenally good at escaping, it seems even dragons can't catch them when they start running! But... Ugh... You were very stubborn! You tracked them for several years, tried to get them drunk in taverns, and several times gave in to them, allowing them to play with your body. Until after months of captivity, one of the witches finally forgot about you and went for new toys! Ah? What?! She... She just ordered a blaster from an ancient phone in the ruins, and it appeared in front of her?! Tearing off the chains, you grabbed the phone.
<p style="color: #E73333FF;text-align: right;">Welcome to MazeShow Store! How may I serve you?</p>A melodic and strangely familiar voice sounded... <p style="color: #E73333FF;text-align: right;">Ah? Anon!? Damn, I told them not to tell you!</p>

### Hikki

You spent a huge amount of time, effort, and gold, but you managed to gather a superb collection of ancient technology. Top computers, servers, solar panels, various electronics... There were even absolutely amazing devices, surely from secret laboratories! And most importantly... Ah... There was a huge collection of comics, anime, movies, and games! Almost everything that ancient civilization created! And even more - because advanced neural networks can generate the ending of your favorite series that you didn't finish watching in your past life due to the invasion! And you're going to enjoy this fully, locking yourself in your lair! Ha, dragons often sleep for months, right? So you'll just watch movies all through this long night, haha!

### Dessert Factory

The journey with the caravan turned out to be incredibly long and full of exciting adventures! Oh, I mean dangers, because all the other guards risked their lives every day while you just enjoyed a carefree journey, driving away monsters with simple breaths of fire. You had long been curious about where these huge automatic wagons came from, and at the end of the journey, you found out the answer to this mystery. Deep in the lifeless wasteland, where dragons don't fly because it's boring and there's nothing to do, people managed to almost restore civilization! Huge factories, oil rigs, a strange mix of steampunk and western, magic and ancient electronic technologies! Golems, cowboys, tamed monsters, desert nagas! It's so cool here!

### Test Subject

Everything was so wonderful, you studied technology, electronics, and all that... Ah... But when someone suggested studying the power of dragons, saying it was incredibly important for all of humanity, you had to agree... Because you'll never be able to catch even the smallest dragon without its pack finding out! You're the only possible test subject in this situation! And... uh... Years have passed... They learned to block your powers and keep you in a cage... At first, they said it was necessary so that the dragons wouldn't sense your cries for help during the experiments... Ah, it was so painful and humiliating... Through the armored glass, you saw new technology and new people appear... Years passed, and it seemed everyone had forgotten that you weren't a wild monster they had caught...

### Dark Lord

The thirst for power, strength, and violence in you turned out to be as strong as among real dragons! So within a few years, people were already telling stories with a shudder about the cruel, perverted half-dragon. And over time, you even managed to conquer enough lands to declare your own kingdom and became a true dark lord! FemDom? MaleDom? Hahaha! Those lowlifes in Mistressia and Lordshold never knew how to have real fun, and only in your kingdom will slaves be turned into real masochists! You'll even make them immortal so they can be tortured, tormented, and raped especially brutally!

### Dragon Milker

Dragon semen is one of the best sources of energy in this world, but these bastards usually fuck once every couple of years! And even when you once got lucky to receive a full load, he came only once and then just fell asleep! But... that was enough for you to have enough power to brutally reverse-rape a young dragon! This time you milked his balls completely! Every last drop, even if it took a whole month! And you became even stronger, which means there are other dragons ahead! More, stronger! You need all their cocks, and someday you'll fuck all the dragons in the world!

![Dragon Milker](images/R72C22.avif)

### Big Girl

Oh, you became damn big, damn strong girl! Filled with energy, you equaled the dragons in strength, and in size, you became like a whole building! You were even accepted into one of the packs, so now you can live in the dragon mountains! Their legends, their rituals, magic, great knowledge are so vast that you would probably spend centuries just getting acquainted with a part of it! However, dragons live long and learn all their lives! And people... Well, sometimes changing bodies to have fun like in the old good times is fun, but nothing compares to how the great dragons love when they start using magic to please their partner!

![Big Girl](images/R72C23.avif)

### Tiamat's Favorite

In recent years, you have increasingly seen strange dreams filled with visions of huge scaly bodies in the fog. They are so huge that one of their scales could be the size of an entire planet! This... This is so incredible that every time you wake up, because your pitiful brain can't grasp even a billionth of the greatness of these beings... Or this being? Other dragons say it's very similar to Tiamat, their great goddess... It's very strange that she was interested in such a young dragon as you, and it seems this is the beginning of incredibly unbelievable adventures!

![Tiamat's Favorite](images/R72C24.avif)

### Princess-Knight

Beautiful, strong, perfectly disguised! You became a legendary princess-knight whose adventures were sung in every tavern! Maybe you don't have your own kingdom yet, but even aristocrats and kings readily call you a princess and always invite you to feasts whenever you appear in their lands. And princes and heroes literally run after you in packs, dreaming of marrying you or at least participating in your incredible adventures! Ha, even when they accidentally noticed your tail, which you usually hide, you just said it was a curse, and they immediately believed you, so now you don't have to hide anymore!

![Princess-Knight](images/R72C25.avif)

### Fire Goddes

Fire became not just your favorite element - you merged with it so much that you yourself turned into it, gaining a new form! Fire hair? Tail? Overheating? Ha, now you're entirely made of fire like an elemental, and your attacks can incinerate anything! Just will it, and fire storms and elementals will scorch everything to the horizon! People tremble and call you the fire goddess, and even young dragons prefer not to mess with you anymore, fearing your wrath! And most of the great dragons, you can now hide in the underground fire seas where your new friends - elementals live!

![Fire Goddes](images/R72C26.avif)

### Centaurid

The longer you lived, the more it seemed to you that your weak human body was somewhat inferior... No, of course, big bouncy tits are great, but... sometimes you just wanted to run on strong, clawed legs! Feel real strength, grow real dragon scales! Thick and strong! And one day this desire became so unbearable that your body changed again! You almost became a dragon! And most importantly - you learned to change this additional form in just a couple of days, so now you can wag your beautiful ass in the city and run like a dragon-centaur girl during your adventures!

![Centaurid](images/R72C27.avif)

### Final Form

When you accumulated so much energy that you literally glowed in the dark, during a tense battle with a strong enemy, your body flashed brightly and took its final form! A huge and powerful dragon with incredibly long and agile limbs like a human! A long tail can split mountains with one blow, your majestic wings eclipse the sun, and magic itself flatters you like a loyal and devoted pet! Although you can only take the final form for an hour a year, even that is enough to crush any enemy and earn the respect of all dragons. They even say that Tiamat herself blessed you!

![Final Form](images/R72C28.avif)

### Prince of Chaos

You spent more and more time in the temple of the Great Nameless. And now you not only participated in lewd rituals, enjoying the pleasure that Dark One gives... No... you increasingly heard his quiet whisper, penetrating the deepest recesses of your consciousness.... He promised to help you... Fulfill all your desires... You still want to revenge against the dragons for what they did to your world, right? For killing your family, your loved ones... For destroying your life and turning you into a crazy, lustful masochist ready to give herself to any monster... He promised to help you destroy them, cleanse this world of their filth.... The Whisperer in the Dark told you more than the most faithful cultists, gave you power for revenge, taught you great magic... And changed your body, which became something else, something terrible and powerful! And now you carry his will, leaving only ashes and despair behind!

![Prince of Chaos](images/R72C29.avif)

### Hell

You often wondered how it happened that the brave and incredibly brave dragons fled their world. I mean, they never flee and are ready to fight to the last drop of blood, right? Ready to tear apart any opponent, and their power is such that they can even travel between worlds! And, as it turned out, they did not flee in terror... Just their entire home world turned into a burning hell, where they still fight with Dark Gods and their monsters! Several planets have already been shattered by their great magic, space itself is warped by the black magic of the gods, and even the star there burns with black flame! And when the young generation of dragons went to that world to help, you felt the call of your blood father. He is there. He has been fighting all these hundreds of years and now invites you to join the great war against darkness! Because he remembers your desperate bravery and luck! Survive here for at least a year, and you will truly be equal to the great dragons!

![Hell](images/R72C30.avif)

### 40k Ways to Die

A year later, you returned from that hell. No, even hell with demons would now seem like a resort to you... This darkness, this cosmic evil... It must be stopped, because otherwise, the Dark Gods will appear in this world! They have already devoured countless billions of worlds, crushing humanity again and again throughout the multiverse! And only dragons protect your world! Now you understand this, and that's why you returned only to go to the dragon elders. Because humanity can help them! You just need to allow the development of technologies! Thermonuclear bombs are already powerful enough, and humanity is capable of much more! Together, combining technology and magic, people and dragons, you will certainly be able to at least push back the forces of Chaos! And it seems you know one undead Emperor who has been bored on his throne for hundreds of years... You are sure he will be happy to lead humanity in this greatest of wars! And scientists from Mars will help with technologies!

![40k Ways to Die](images/R72C31.avif)

### Master of Space

It took many years, but the dragons helped you master your power to perfection. Your space magic turned out to be incredibly powerful. Demigod? Hah... Once you dreamed of equaling them, but now even the ancient gods of humans like Thor or Zeus would be pathetic weaklings compared to you. Because you can literally extinguish the sun or tear it to shreds! And with your help in the Great War, you finally managed to push back Chaos! Yes, the home world of the dragons was maimed by your magic, many black holes that you attacked the most terrible spawn of the Dark Gods with are still dangerously close, but for the first time, among countless worlds, someone really managed to resist their power! Let them return again, let their whisper still seduce mortals, but at least you gave this world hope!
