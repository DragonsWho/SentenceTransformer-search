title: Saintess

## Saintess CYOA

Bless you.

I apologize for intercepting your soul midway to oblivion. I was in dire need of an emissary to my realm, and I believe you are the perfect candidate for this sacred mission.

You will be transported to a realm where magic and steampunk intertwine.   
Here, steel and steam reign supreme as colossal locomotives, powered by mystical flames instead of coal, traverse the railway tracks. As dusk descends, the cityscape is illuminated with the enchanting glow of numerous magical lanterns. And sometimes real miracles happen in this magical world.

In this realm, you will assume the venerable destiny of the Saint Maiden, tasked with unraveling the mysteries of the Cathedral and solving predicaments...

Once here, your destiny becomes set in stone, with the only escape being the most desperate act of suicide. Even the deities themselves cannot impede such a choice.

Yet, I urge you to hold onto hope and persevere, no matter what obstacles lie ahead! If you can persevere, your life shall flourish beyond your wildest imagination!

Do not be deterred by the challenges you may face. Rest assured that I will help you prepare, because without a doubt, your success is of paramount importance. 

##  


There are many races in this vast world. Elves, beastmen, demons, and half-dragons, among others.

But you will belong to the Cathedral that is in the proud capital of the human nation. Within its hallowed walls, you, as a magnificent human maiden, will be chosen to embody the holiness of your people as their cherished "saint". 

Once elected, deserting the Cathedral becomes a tall order, except in extraordinary circumstances.

Unfortunately, this sacred place has been tainted by deceit, subjecting the faithful sisters to reprehensible acts and vile rituals. Prepare yourself, for the journey ahead will be perilous, dear child. Abandon all efforts to preserve your innocence, for you will be plunged into a world where surrender to physical ecstasy is the key to fulfilling your divine destiny.

As a former saint myself, I have tasted the temptation of man and can attest that this path is far from easy.  

<b>Before you embark, I implore you to ensure that you have a reserve of no less than 1000 energy points. That way, I can help you in your darkest hour. </b>

## Will you accept your fate?



### Receive a saint's blessing



### Reject the offer and disappear



## Age

So let's get started. 
What is the desired age you would like to look like?

### Almost Kid

A young and immature.
You'll often be restricted like an unreasonable child, and it's perfect for playing an innocent and silly kid that no one will seriously punish.

### Teenager

The most common age for nuns.
At this age, they are usually attending holy magic classes at the cathedral. It's so ordinary, so mundane, that you're often overlooked.

### Adult

Mature enough to conceive a child.
You will have much more freedom of action, but the sexual demands on you will increase significantly.

## Body

Now tell me, how refined do you want your body to be?
You can enlarge your breasts and hips as much as you want, and your features will be refined to be exquisitely beautiful in the eyes of all.
Oh, and by the way, itâ€™s possible to have the most unique eye and hair colors imaginable, so feel free to choose whatever suits your fancy. But if you can't decide, I'll grant you shimmering platinum hair and blue eyes, the way people usually imagine the Saintless.

### Petite

Young form, imbued with the promise of burgeoning femininity. Youthful curves are highly sought after by some... enthusiasts. And there are a lot of them in this world.

### Average

A healthy, average female body with well-developed breasts and a firm ass.
Nothing extraordinary, but it's the kind of look that appeals to the widest range of tastes.

### Sensual

A body in which the feminine nature inherent in the genes has blossomed. You are sure to attract the attention of men with your beautiful breasts that sway charmingly when you walk.

## Saint's Basic Abilities

As a true saint, you will be blessed by the Divine and manifest in this world with extraordinary talents that will aid you in your all-embracing growth.

However, these talents are merely potentials awaiting your personal development.

But you have the freedom to choose to give up any of those abilities right now.

### Angel

You have the ability to temporarily transform into a biblical angel, granting you enhanced abilities and increased power. However, do not be deceived by the Church's portrayal of angels as divine beings with fancy wings and halo. It is all mere illusion, void of true meaning. The essence of this ability remains a mystery.

It is up to you to uncover the truth behind it.

### Sacred Body

Your face is one to be admired, exuding an air of grace and sheer beauty. In addition, your physical prowess and strength are nothing short of awe-inspiring.
It should be noted, however, that you have a weakness when it comes to men.
As for your appearance, your skin, hair, and physique will forever remain in a state of perfection. The passage of time has no power over you, for you will forever retain your youthful appearance. In addition, your body has a wonderful ability to heal itself quickly.

### Geniusness

You have the extraordinary intellectual abilities of a true prodigy. The realms of understanding are open to you like no other, and you effortlessly conquer any challenge that comes your way. However, it is of utmost importance for you to embrace humility and realize that although you are exceptionally intelligent, you are not invincible.

Synergy with [Magic Talent].

### Blessed Spirit

Your heart will blossom with boundless generosity. Your intuition will be sharpened to unparalleled depths, allowing you to unravel the most vexing mysteries with keen wisdom. Your optimistic and hopeful demeanor will captivate all who are fortunate enough to see it.
But do not lose sight of the fact that even the most benevolent heart has its limits.
When you impart your heartfelt advice, those who receive it will be in awe and will follow it wholeheartedly.

## Talents

Before you go beyond the point of no return, allow me to bestow upon you some additional gifts that will serve you well. 

Think wisely and make your choice.

### Martial Arts

Armed with a weapon, you become an unstoppable force. Your leg kicks also have irresistible power, and in a defensive stance, you can easily block the attacks of a master martial artist from any school.
Every sword wielded in your hand becomes sacred in the battle against demons.

Synergy with [Gunslinger]

### Gunslinger

You can draw, fire, and reload your firearm with unparalleled speed. Even the most elusive of magical creatures will find themselves unable to escape the relentless onslaught of your bullets. Revolver, rifle, or machine gun, no target will escape the piercing accuracy of your aim, aimed precisely at their vulnerable points. As a saint, you stand as a hunter of demons. 
Synergy with [Martial Arts]

### Magic Talents

You possess the innate talent of a sorcerer, making any spell seem effortlessly within your grasp. Intuitively, you know the perfect angle from which to unleash a fireball and the precise incantation for maximum potency. Even the simplest of spells become immensely powerful in your capable hands.
As a Saintess, your affinity for light and star magic is unmatched.
Synergy with [Geniusness]

### Holy Miracles

You can now effortlessly heal any wound or injury.
You will have the ability to bestow additional blessings on your allies, strengthening them and protecting them from evil witchcraft.
As a Saintess, your healing abilities are second to none.

This skill is a perfect complement to the [Magic Talent] option.

### Sacred Aura

There is a certain sacred aura associated with you as a saint, though it is unfounded.
For some inexplicable reason, people will perceive you as a pure maiden, and even the slightest contact with your delicate skin will be deemed sacrilegious. 
However, be cautious, for this effect does not extend to those affiliated with the Cathedral.

### Allure

Your holy powers will enhance your charms.
No one will be able to resist your sexual demands.
This is much more powerful than an illusion spell.
Be careful how you use it, as it can be triggered subconsciously.

### Unbreakable Will

No matter what happens, you won't give in to the situation. No matter what they do to you, you will continue to believe in a good ending.
But staying sane when there's nothing left to do...

It also means giving up your last resort.

### Painless Birth

You have the innate ability to conceive and deliver with remarkable ease and expediency. 
Whether it be tentacles, eggs, insects, or mammals, the choice is yours.
But your genes will no longer mix with your offspring, and your bloodline will end there.

### Soul Gem

The gem will be embedded in your womb, growing in potency with the infusion of male seed. Should your own energy fade, the Soul Gem embedded in your core will sustain you, but know that it is a sacred artifact bound to you forever. You will not be able to conceive a child in the future, so choose wisely for there will be no turning back.

### Age Shift

You can control the age of your body at will once an hour.
You can be the most charming woman for any man, no matter what kind of girl he prefers.

Unless he has a fetish for ugly women... Then it will be impossible for you to seduce him.

### Flexibility

Now, you possess incredibly supple joints, granting you the ability to effortlessly contort into alluring poses and even lick your oun ass.

Moreover, this newfound flexibility also offers you a distinct advantage in battle, enabling you to gracefully evade the most unforeseen strikes.

### Hentai Physics

Anything considered "sexual" can be done to you in a healthy way.
You can take any enormous objects into your holes. While this may elicit both pleasure and some discomfort, rest assured that no permanent damage will be done. Give it time, and your hole will eventually recover.

### Blessing

You can bless guys to make them tireless in sex. Even if they've come a dozen times, you can easily get them hard again.

Remember that as soon as you notice someone is exhausted, you'll have a strong urge to cheer them up.

### Fertility Control

Now you can manage your fertility to avoid unwanted pregnancies.
Or you can let it happen and have a beautiful, healthy baby just like you. 
Highly recommended if you want to live the life of a happy woman.

### Clean

From now on, the fragrance of your body will be everlasting, and every possession of yours will shine with spotless cleanliness. Even the traces of semen that may have found their way into your mouth, vagina, or anus will be banished as you rise to your feet.
However, you will be forced to use the bathroom like any other mortal.

### Pure

 You will be the epitome of purity. You will be able to clean things with a single touch, so that even if you accidentally stumble in the mud, the dirt will simply vanish in an instant. 

In addition, your angelic purity will free you from the need to use a toilet like an ordinary mortal.  

## Guardian Barrier 

From now on, I will no longer be able to influence you with my power. 

I apologize, but my suppressed abilities are not sufficient to breach this barrier and remain undetected. Should I attempt such an action, the delicate balance could be upset, allowing the evil that rules this realm to manipulate your decisions. So from now on, you should only rely on yourself.

It is not too late to review the talents you have chosen.

## Stations

You find yourself standing in a crowded place, clutching a suitcase you have been carrying for some time.
Dazed, you turn to see the doors of a steam-powered locomotive closing behind you, sealing your fate. The resounding blast of a mighty horn echoes through the air as the colossal steel monster begins its gradual departure as you walk along the ornate platform.

The spacious station is overflowing with a sea of people dressed in vintage clothing that exudes an irresistible charm. At a glance, you can tell that these figures are none other than members of high society, the wealthy and respected. Something draws their gaze to you, as if you possess an enigmatic allure. Taking one tentative step after another, you move forward, clomping your heels.

Amidst the surrounding crowd, you happen to catch sight of a divinely beautiful maiden. She immediately captures your attention. Entranced and momentarily lost in her presence, you fix your gaze on her radiant eyes. 

. . . . .

Suddenly you realize that the object of your affection is none other than your own reflection in a giant mirror. The enchanting goddess has kept her promise and transformed you into a breathtaking vision of beauty.

As you shake off the shock, you find yourself drawn to the presence of a majestic and colossal cathedral that stands resolutely next to the bustling train station. With an instinctive understanding that this is your destination, you make your way towards it.

## Cathedral

With a resounding clang and the mechanical whir of enormous gears, the towering doors swung open to reveal the breathtaking interior of the Cathedral. Adorned with exquisite statues and gleaming gold ornaments, the space exuded an overwhelming impression of opulence and majesty.

As you stepped inside, your imagination was stirred by the thought that the sale of just one of the magnificent works of art stored there could provide a lifetime of wealth.

"It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to the Cathedral. I am Benedict, the cardinal who has been eagerly awaiting your arrival," the man in the immaculate white robe said with a graceful bow.

Feeling somewhat dazed, you looked around, still struggling to fully comprehend the situation unfolding before you.

"I understand that you are suffering from amnesia. Please don't worry and take your time. Let me carry your suitcase. And first of all, we must provide you with a suitable vestment," Cardinal Benedict offered reassuringly.

As you followed the cardinal, a thought occurred to you: "Could it be that the Goddess herself has orchestrated your fortunate amnesia as part of your destiny?" Intrigued, you remained silent and allowed him to lead the way.

## Clothing Restrictions

"There will be a physical examination," the cardinal announced calmly, his voice echoing through the room. "Please undress and fold your clothes. You will not be using them again."

In a state of confusion, you hesitated for a moment, but soon realized that there was no turning back. Taking a deep breath, you obediently removed each article of clothing and discarded them on a nearby surface. The Cardinal's scrutinizing gaze made you feel exposed, like vulnerable prey.

After meticulously examining you from head to toe, the cardinal motioned to the pristine white table in front of him and urged you to take a seat. Tentatively, you complied, the cool surface cooling your bare skin. The Cardinal's next instruction caught you off guard.

"Spread your buttocks," he ordered, his tone devoid of compassion.

Obeying his command, you parted your cheeks with your trembling hands, feeling an unwelcome breeze swirl around your most intimate areas. As the Cardinal examined this vulnerable sight, your face flushed with a mixture of shame and embarrassment, recalling the Goddess' warning of the corruption festering within the hallowed halls of the Cathedral.

Without warning, he forcefully inserted a rough finger into your anus, causing you to jerk in surprise. He twisted it inside for a moment, then withdrew his finger and licked it with pleasure, savoring your taste.

"Since you have been designated as a Saintess, your clothing must be restricted. You don't have to wear it all the time, but these rules will apply when you participate in rituals or make public appearances. The Cathedral will not tolerate any transgressions and will take appropriate measures to reprimand those who deviate from the code."

His words hung in the air, both ominous and foreboding. With an air of authority, the Cardinal continued, "Now, allow me to provide you with a costume befitting a Saintess. These garments are of the utmost importance and have magical protection. Should they be misplaced, they will be returned to you within twenty-four hours. However, it is crucial to understand that the loss of such items will result in severe consequences and punishment."

### Barefoot Exposition

This is one of the most common ways saints have dressed throughout human history.
Although it is acceptable to wear some shoes, make sure that the feet remain visible either through stockings or sandals. Alternatively, you can choose to go barefoot as per your preference.  

### No Bra

You are prohibited from wearing a bra.

As a Saintess, your breasts are perfect in every way, shape, and form. They mustnâ€™t be covered up.
I don't think you need to worry about that.

### Nipple Cutouts

 In memory of all the mothers who nursed their babies with milk, you will have special cutouts on your clothes so that people can admire your sacred nipples. 

They may even be sucked during some rituals.

### No Panties

Your crotch should not be covered with anything.
For the true purpose of a woman is to receive a man's sperm in her vagina, to conceive and bear children.
You are no exception to this, for you, as Saintess, should be an example to all women.

### Side-Cut Dress

We will modify the costume for you.
As a Saintess, it is imperative that you retain your femininity, so we will remove the side piece to make it clear that you are not wearing undergarments.

Your costume will be designed to allow you to easily accept sexual activity when necessary.

### Pendant

Is this, uh... from your suitcase?

It must be carried at all times... Failure to do so will result in...
Uh... Anyway, no one dares to touch sacred symbol, so you don't have to worry about that.

### Corset

This is a device to make the waist more feminine.
You do not need it, of course, but you should wear it to set an example for your parishioners.

### Blindfold

The saint must always wear a black eye patch, a symbol of fair judgment.
It's a symbol, so it doesn't actually blind you.

You are free to modify it, such as putting a modern visor in it.

### Veil

As a holy being, you should flaunt your status through your veil.

It will also come in handy to conceal your identity when you leave the cathedral.

### Leash

A true Saintess does not belong to herself. She is led and guided by God, destiny, and even people. 

That's why you wear this leash, so you don't forget that.

### Ring

A ring enchanted with an alluring spell is placed on your finger.

If worn on the ring finger of the left hand, it will induce powerful rape urges in all nearby males.
We recommend wearing it on the index finger.

### Bracelets

Your wrists will be adorned with shiny bracelets.

This has the effect of making you appear more fragile and delicate.

### Cuffing Ribbon

Saintess should never resist fate, no matter what happens to her, for her faith in God is strong and unbreakable. To demonstrate this, we will give you a ribbon of St. Lekah, who did not resist even martyrdom. 

Don't worry, it's just a ribbon and you can easily untie it yourself. 

### Anklets

To really accentuate your sophistication, it is imperative that you adorn your ankle with a delicate gold anklet.

It is no longer acceptable to wear footwear that rises above the ankle.

### Anal Plug

You must always act with the blessed plug in your anus.
You may only temporarily remove it when going to the bathroom or with the permission of a cardinal or higher cleric. 
Normally, this may cause problems with bowel function, but it is not a problem for a Saintess.

### Semen

It is the sacred duty of every woman to receive a man's seed. Therefore, you should always have at least some fresh semen on your skin. It may be hidden from others, but you should always feel it.

We will give you a magic vial that will stay full of fresh sperm, or you can ask anyone for a favor. 

### Ear Piercings

You'll get an ear-piercing. 
Almost all girls wear this standard piece of feminine jewelry.
Since it belongs to a saint, we'll customize it with a particularly holy design.

### Navel Piercing

Place the piercing where the umbilical cord used to be. A sacred symbol of the bond between mother and child.
At first you will feel pain every time you breathe, but it will get easier.

### Nipple Piercing

You will have shiny piercings in both your breasts to emphasize your femininity.
It will be painful and strange, but you'll love it.

So they say.

### Clitoral Piercing

Place the shiny jewelry on your clitoris, on your sacred womanhood.
The installation will be painful, but it will increase your sensitivity.
Feel free to choose your own design, you can even wear several at the same time.

## Rules

Dressed in sacred vestments, you delicately lift the suitcase, which has been meticulously inspected, and ascend the grand staircase, traveling along the corridor until you reach the room indicated by the Cardinal.

As you enter and take the case inside, you find yourself in a room that still bears traces of its former grandeur.

Your attention is caught by a pristine, newly printed sheet of paper lying on the table. You gently pick it up and begin to read its contents.

[The following set of Ten Commandments applies universally to all saints. Violations will be met with retribution from the Cathedral.
If you wish, you can mitigate the consequences by sacrificing 100 points of energy].

### Quiet

A Saintess should not engage in meaningless conversation.
She should be seen as a silent, graceful presence.

### Truth

A Saintess is obligated to tell the truth, regardless of the circumstances. 
She has the option of either remaining silent or honestly admitting her lack of accurate knowledge.

### Obedience

A Saintess must be absolutely submissive to male authority.
She is obligated to provide sexual services to any man who requests it at any time.

### Don't swear

A Saintess should never, under any circumstances, use vulgar language that includes profanity.
If such behavior is exposed to the public, she will be considered corrupt.

### Respect

A holy woman must show perfect courtesy to her superior clergy.
This is because it is God's will that women serve under men.

### Financial Supervision

A Saintess should not spend money recklessly.
She must have a responsible person who carefully supervises all her expenditures.

### Diligence

A Saintess must carry out whatever order the Cardinal deems necessary.
Be it the birth of a child by a tentacle monster or a holy crusade.

### Lawfulness

A Saintess should not break the law, no matter what.
For she must be an example of obedience to social rules, however immoral and evil they may be.

### Chastity

A Saintess should not have sexual relations with lay people without permission.
It is only allowed with the special permission of the Cathedral.

### Faith

A saint must memorize the contents of the Bible perfectly, but if a conflict of priorities arises between the Cathedral and the Holy Scriptures, the will of the Cathedral must always prevail.

## Flaws

You look in the mirror, take a deep breath, and start to think about what weaknesses you have and how you are going to deal with them.

### Exhibitionism

You like to show off obscene body parts, don't you?
A revealing Saintess outfit is just the excuse you need to stop hiding your desire for exhibitionism.

You're probably going to enjoy this life.

### Laziness

Are you not comforted by the embrace of your bed, longing to spend more time basking in its warmth and comfort? You're always trying to sleep longer than others and work less.
While this is a common symptom in highly talented people, you know that you can't afford it right now.

### Masochism

Pain and humiliation give you sexual pleasure. Hmm, and there are plenty of men in the Cathedral who would be happy to help you with that.

It's going to be a very satisfying life.

### Sadism

Do you like the idea of dominating men? Or maybe you prefer dominating girls? Do you like to hurt and humiliate others?

Either way, while it's a worthy hobby, it's unlikely to serve you well in the Cathedral. 

### Vulnerable Look

Your vulnerable appearance and cute face will charm your tormentors.
This aura and your sweet screams will make them punish you even more.

It's perfect for a masochist.

### Lactation

Your breasts will produce milk as if you were nursing your children. This will be an advantage to you, the symbol of the ideal woman.

Your milk will be highly valued and used for ritual purposes.

### Always Wet

Your holes are always ready to receive a cock.
Both your vagina and anus are always wet, soft and slippery.

You have to be careful or you might even slip if you get too excited without panties.

### High Fertility

Now you can easily conceive and give birth to a child no matter what.

These are the duties of a woman in any world. Accept it humbly. 

### Pubic Hair

You will grow pubic hair, a symbol of a fertile woman.
If you have a [Sacred Body], even if you shave it off, it will grow back immediately because of the holy powers, and you will have no choice but to accept it.
For some people it is a symbol of love. Maybe you can learn to view it positively as well.

### Sensitive Anal

Your anus is extremely sensitive.
If it is even slightly stimulated, you will immediately come. The same goes for going to the bathroom.

It will be quite amusing when men discover your weakness.

### Ahegao

From now on, you will be accustomed to getting a funny and lustful look on your face when sexual stimulation exceeds a certain level. Of course, this will only irritate your partners.

This will be repeated endlessly, so fainting will be your only escape from the ongoing rape.

### Nymphomaniac

You will have an irrepressible sexual appetite, which can be exorbitant.
At first you will demand an orgasm once a day, but gradually you will want more and more sex.

The Cathedral seems to be the perfect place to satisfy your lust.

## Duties

As you enter the main hall of the cathedral, a solemn and sublime hymn is heard. Soon a familiar cardinal approaches you.

"Did you get enough rest yesterday, Saintess?
Now it is time for you to take charge of your duties in the Cathedral. Follow me and I will tell you what you must do this year." He said, putting his hand on your butt.

### Dancer

You will be required to dance during the festivities in a revealing exotic dancer costume.
This is a great opportunity to show the parishioners that the Saintess is healthy and happy, and will help brighten the dull days.
But keep in mind that you may be called upon for special services afterward.

### Gladiator

You will take part in monthly fights in the arena of the capital. With weapons in hand, you must defend your honor and inspire hope in the hearts of the spectators.

Keep in mind, however, that if you lose, you may be subjected to a 24-hour rape show with the other contestants.

### Maid of War

When war breaks out, you must take part by commanding an army or demonstrating your swordsmanship.  You can also destroy the enemy with fire or heal the wounded - the role is up to you.

Please note that relations with the Elven Empire are currently tense and war may break out soon.

If you are victorious, great glory awaits you. But if you fail, your fate will be decided by the victors.

### Diplomatic Tool

You have been asked to provide sexual entertainment for a powerful political figure for one day.
Don't think too much about it, just think of it as prostitution for hire and remember that it will help the Cathedral and the Faith greatly.

### City Explorer

You get permission from the Cathedral to move around the city at your leisure. You can just walk around or go shopping in a store.

This is probably the closest thing you can get to a vacation.

### Dungeon Explorer

You don't know about it because of "amnesia," but recently a mysterious ancient dungeon was discovered underground. It hides demons of all stripes, writhing tentacles, and the moans of hapless explorers, some of whom are raped there for months until someone rescues them. The dungeon is said to be connected to the demonic realm, but no one knows for sure. You must explore it for twenty hours a week. You can become much stronger here, unless you lose to the monsters themselves. 
If you do not return in time, you will be rescued by a group of adventurers and then severely punished.

### Penances

For one hour each day, you will be required to perform penances that is mandatory for all nuns.

Note that you as a Saintess will be assisted by priests.

### Cup of Sins

Each week you will be brought a full mug of fresh and still hot sperm from the congregation. As a Saintess, you will have to pray and consume their sins by drinking every last drop of sperm.

### Self-Sacrifice

So that the girls in the city don't have to suffer at the hands of sex maniacs, fortnightly you will disguise yourself as a normal city girl and go to the darkest streets. You should let every horny bastard rape you, empty his balls for months, and at the end be sure to give him absolution and thank him for choosing you over an innocent girl.

### Exorcism

Some of the nuns are clearly possessed by sinful thoughts, so you will need to help your sisters in faith get rid of these silly thoughts and banish all sins from them. They will be securely tied to beds, and the Cathedral will provide you with all the necessary toys and potions. You can only finish when they begin to beg to be returned to the priests and agree to do anything for them.

### Confessions

For one hour a day you act as a confessor who absolves the citizens of their sins.

In particular, you are obliged to accept all the lust of your parishioners, for blessed sex with a saint is not adultery. To come to you for confession, one can either win a special lottery or spend an enormous amount of money.

### Cathedral Office Assistant

As a Saintess, you don't have to help priests with their paperwork. But if you wish...

You will help them run the Cathedral. Fill out forms, help with bookkeeping, purchase sex toys, get paid for the nuns' service. If you work diligently, you may eventually be entrusted with more important tasks.

### Dungeon Core

Deep in the dungeons you have uncovered some of the secrets of this world.
Now it's time to face the truth about the Cathedral. Your holy powers have reached their limit, and it's time to set things right.

## Chastisement

You may be adorned with the sacred title of Saintess, but even you must answer for your misdeeds.

Whether you have broken the law, violated the sacred teachings of the Cathedral, or suffered chastisement at the hands of the cardinal, rest assured that the Cathedral will mete out appropriate punishment.

Behold, here is a list of the disciplinary measures you will face.

### Compulsory Service

Once a day, you must serve a person chosen by the Cathedral.

Only members of the Cathedral may participate in the selection.

### Repentance

One of the traditional penances.
The torturer assists the saint in her sexual repentance.

Depending on the circumstances, this may include "rape torture".

### Anal Only

A Saintess needs to be more modest so you'll be put in a chastity belt. You won't be able to even touch your pussy for a whole week. Of course, this does not cancel out your other duties or chastisements, so you will have to get used to anal.

### Prison

You will be held in a punishment cell in the basement of the Cathedral.
Given your status, you will be given a balanced diet, unlike the prisoners.

If your sins are great, you will spend time in the same cell with a sex maniac condemned for a lifetime.

### Wall of Shame

You will be fixed in the wall for a random amount of time so that you are just a fuck toy for the men.
Of course, your picture will also be there so that everyone can easily recognize you.

### Tentacle Pregnancy

As a Saintess, you must bring new life into this world. But it's a punishment, so this time you'll have to carry big tentacle eggs and give birth to a horrible monster that will start raping you before it's even born.
As disgusting as this is, the good news is that your offspring will have no genetic connection to you and will require no responsibility from you.

### Box of Redemption

You are locked in a box and displayed in a random place on the street. 

It's actually a little bigger than the picture, so you can use your pussy and anus. The punishment will only end when 100 men have come inside you.

### Naked Dogeza

To prove your repentance, you must humbly expose yourself and bow before the congregation.

It's all right. The townspeople will take the saint's actions for granted. Some will spit at you or step on you just to make you feel your contrition.

### Piercing

You will be pierced in all your erogenous zones for a period of one month.
The size and number of piercings will be proportional to your sins.
If there is already a piercing in that place, it will be replaced with a larger and heavier piercing.

The saint's body will fully recover from any piercings, so you do not have to worry that your appearance will be ruined.

### Latex Suit

You will be locked in a latex bondage suit for twenty-four hours. This suit is specially designed by MazeShow Corp to stretch and fit perfectly around your body, so that you can be fucked right in it. All it takes is a little push with a dick and it will stretch like a condom, slipping into your pussy or anus.

### Earn this Honor

 You'll be handed over to the filthy street dogs. For a whole day, you'll be their bitch to be raped nonstop. Their huge knots will stretch your holes and their claws will scratch your tender skin. I think after that you'll understand what an honor it is to be used by humans.

### Womb Tattoo

A magical tattoo will be placed on your abdomen, just opposite your sacred womb. 
It will activate your sexual desire and liberate you to the utmost.

It can be removed after a week, but you can keep it if you want.

### Pregnancy Training

The special seal will prevent semen from leaking out of your pussy. So every drop of semen will stay inside, fresh and warm, gradually swelling your belly. The seal is only broken when your belly is the same size as if you were 9 months pregnant. If you try hard enough, it won't take long.

### Public Excretion

For 24 hours, you will be required to use a designated bathroom. It is a clear glass cube in the center of the cathedral where you can be seen by the congregation. Don't worry, if the stares make you uncomfortable, you can spend as much time as you need to relax.

### Proximity to People

Whatever you think you can do because you're a saintess, you will be reminded of what it means to be human. Your anus will be stretched and a funnel will be inserted into it and then filled with various garbage. They will piss right into you and use you as a toilet. Of course, you will soon be clean again, but you will remember the disgusting sensation for a long time.

### Naked Roaming

As Saintess, you must walk through all the slums of the city wearing only a light cloak with a hood.

This is a sacred ceremony to commemorate the deeds of St. Lekah.

### Pear of Anguish

 You will endure the same torture as many holy martyrs before you. A pear of anguish will be inserted into your pussy or anus and stretch it to the breaking point. And a little beyond, so that you'll remember this punishment well.

## Crossroads of Fate

Stop for a moment. This is your final destination.
Are you sure of the path you've chosen? That you don't want to change? It's not too late to change.

Because if you go on, you won't be able to come back. 

So...

...God bless you.

### Face Your Destiny



## Endings

Thank you for all your hard work! It's been so long since I've seen you. And it's time to meet your destiny that you've been heading towards all this time.

Now it is your turn to be executed.

### Execution

Sadly, Saintess, your time in this world is coming to an end. You must now embrace martyrdom and pave the way for the next saint to rise. I deeply regret that your life must end, but we are grateful for the profound emotions we shared with all the faithful as we witnessed your final chapter.

Rest in peace. 

### Return

I can see that you have tried, but I have not been able to find out the truth.
Out of respect for your sincerity, I will use the stored energy to return you to the world you came from.

I'm sorry, but there's no way to restore your old body. But a saintess's body is amazing, isn't it?

### Goddess

The execution ceremony was somehow interrupted, and you were staring dumbly at the ceiling in your room, not knowing what to expect, when you heard a voice.

"You deserve to see the truth that lies beyond. Return to the heart of abyss."

## Last Choice



### Save the world



### Making this world even more depraved



## 



### Beg for mercy



## 



### Raped to Death

You wanted to live so desperately, begged them so passionately to spare you, that they decided to let you stay in this world for a while...

Instead of chopping off your head and finishing it in a minute, they decided to rape you to death. Day after day, men, beasts, and even monsters will ravage your holes without stopping for a moment. Your body is very strong and you can live for months dreaming of death until you finally break and stop breathing. But even then, your body will be toyed with for a few more days, torn apart by huge dicks.
