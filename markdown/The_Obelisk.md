##  

You’ve seen it, in your dreams. A grand spire stretching high, high into the clouds above. It looms in your mind, blotting out even the sky and the grass that surrounds it. There is something for you here. 

You told your master of your dreams. They nodded. Their face betrayed no emotion, nothing more than acceptance. The next day, the two of you were aboard a ship. As you approached, strange happenings befell you both. 

Your body began to feel empty. Hollow. The yearning in your mind grew stronger, unbearable. You had to be strapped to your bed, lest you sleepwalk into the ocean and drown. Your master’s form became unstable. Each day, a member of what you thought to be the crew would appear in your master’s 
clothes. By the fourteenth night, they could not hold any one form, switching between faces as quickly as they breathed. 

They explained the yearning, and the emptiness. You are not human. You are a creature, known only as a Mosaic. When you grow to maturity, your body desires to fill itself with the souls of other creatures. The Obelisk is the place to get what your soul is crying out for. 

Your master taught you to fight. To use weapons. To think strategically and to make the most of your situation. You will take these skills, and climb. Climb to fill yourself with whatever it is you desire. 

<b>You have been granted some small blessings. 80, to be exact.</b>

## Basic Power



##  

Your master explained the power of a Mosaic to you. After defeating a foe in battle, a Mosaic could take attributes from the enemy and apply those to themselves. Defeat, your master stressed, did not need to come in the form of death. This comes in three forms. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Each enemy/item that this can be done with will be marked]<p/>

## 



### Drain

From the lowliest insect, to the greatest of gods, all beings can be described. Their history can be condensed into a few grand moments, their greatest skill can be evidenced, and their power laid bare. You will take their description. You will take what lies below the surface. You will leave them without these qualities. No memory of who they are, no power, and no skill. Wiped clean, and left to grow in new ways.

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[When applied, all the features of a creature/item listed out in dot points will be yours. All of them]</p>

![Drain]()

### Fuse

Your soul cries out for something. Not power, but beauty. This gives you the chance to wear the form of your fallen foe. You do not rip their face from them, as Drain rips away their past. Instead, you merely copy it. You are a Mosaic, after all. But you can only take what is revealed to you. Only gain what you can see. So be careful in your observation.

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[When applied, you will gain a copy of the creature or item’s form. You may turn into it, at any time, and perform any action or use any power that you can see or reasonably glean from the image attached to the option. So if they’re just sitting there with a witch’s hat, you could probably assume they can brew potions. However, you cannot make any assumptions based on their description, only what you see]</p>

![Fuse]()

### Absorb

Your soul is desperate to be filled. You must unleash your true power. This lets you take anything from your foe. Their history will rewrite your own. Their strength will become yours so completely that it will feel as if you always had it. Your face will not be the one you were born with, but the one you chose to have. These are not simply benefits, not simply tools. They become immutable parts of your very existence. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[You may choose any combination of description and picture to apply to yourself. You don’t need to take everything. You can take only one dot point, and apply only one part of their picture to yourself if you want. However, doing this costs twice as many blessings as normal]</p>

![Absorb]()

## Attributes



##  

With how sensitive your body is to what you can do, this only makes sense. Your basic human body has six distinctive traits. Each one corresponds to a body part. As that trait gets stronger, that part grows in turn. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[You may spend blessings on increasing any given stat at one blessing per point. Anything that stays at zero will be slightly below human average. So if you have 0 strength, you'll be a bit weaker than the average human with a smaller cock/pussy. You may redirect the growth from any given stat. If you don’t want your cock to grow, but you do want to be strong, you can redirect all the growth into your ass, for example. This will affect all the growth gained from that stat, so be warned]<p/>

## 



### Strength / Genitals

This attribute determines how strong you are. With each point, your ability to lift, throw, restrain, and move about are increased. As this raw power increases, so too will the length or depth of your genitals increase. One inch at a time. And of course, the stretch capacity of your pussy and the size of your balls won’t be left out.

![Strength / Genitals](images/R10C1.avif)

### Constitution / Breast

Constitution determines your durability. How well you take a punch, how easily you survive a drop, how quickly you heal, how rarely you get sick, and how easily you slurp down bad food. With each point, your breasts grow a cup size too. If milky breasts aren’t your cup of tea, then you'll find a growing pair of pecs on your chest.

![Constitution / Breast](images/R10C2.avif)

### Dexterity / Legs

Sure, the stronger you are, the faster you run. Ahammer moves faster than any piece of a pocket watch, but the watch is infinitely more precise in each of its movements. That’s what dexterity does for you. The higher this stat, the steadier your hands, the better your aim, and the more precisely you move. With the ability to tear up a dance floor, it’s only fair that you’d get legs to go with it. Each increase in this stat thickens your thighs and lengthens your legs. Keep this low, and you’ll be top heavy. Put enough points in, and you’ll be leggy, elegant, and a towering force.

![Dexterity / Legs](images/R10C3.avif)

### Intelligence / Ass

Top to bottom. This stat makes your memory better, both at holding info and in recalling it when you need it. It improves your pattern recognition, sharpens your tactics, and bolsters your resistance to mental magic. As above, so below. With every point that goes into your mind, your ass equals it. It becomes fuller, rounder, tighter. Better.

![Intelligence / Ass](images/R10C4.avif)

### Wisdom / Hair

Wisdom is knowing better. Intelligence is the science, wisdom is the philosophy. What good are tactics if you don’t understand the broader picture? What good are muscles if you can’t pick your battles? What good is precision when you don’t understand what you’re shooting at? Even an idiot can be wise, because they know what works, not necessarily how it works. They take the routes that the smart one is too bogged down in details to see. With every point in wisdom, your hair grows own from your head. Even cutting it will always have it growing back to its true length. Not only is it long, but increasing this stat comes with thickness, vibrancy, shine, and hair so healthy that you'll look like a model, not like you haven't seen a shower in weeks.

![Wisdom / Hair](images/R10C5.avif)

### Luck / Beauty

Unlike the other stats, you cannot simply dump points into this stat endlessly. You may spend no more than six blessings here. With each one, you will become luckier. An explosive may fizzle out. Your path will just miss the horrifying predator. Your starving party will happen upon something edible. It is not something to be relied on, but it will certainly save you in the moments you need it most. As your luck grows, your beauty will do the same. Each blessing will increase the number of people who could find you beautiful. Once you spend all six points, there isn’t a creature alive that could look you in the eyes and deny the beauty they see. Use this power wisely. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Every second level of luck adds +1 to any dice roll]<p/>

![Luck / Beauty](images/R10C6.avif)

## Companions



##  

You arrived on the island of The Obelisk. You saw the tower immediately, looming over everything like a squatting god. You looked closer, seeing a bustling town and community that had built up around this monolith construction. Your master could not follow you any further. Their body was far too corrupted, being this close to the Obelisk. 

They explained to you that many adventurers try to brave the tower. They explained the worth of finding companions to help in your quest to grow stronger. Your master placed a pendant in your hand. It would be their final gift to you. <b>This pendant allowed you to share your power once. Absorb a fallen enemy and give the results to an ally, not just yourself. </b> Then, you disembarked the boat. You hadn’t even a chance to say goodbye before the boat was already pulling away 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Choose as many companions as you can afford]<p/>

## 



### Ysberin

Ysberin is new to being an adult, and is unfocused and easily distracted. She is here to fulfill her childhood dream to learn about the plants of the obelisk. 

Indeed, despite her naivety, her powers and connection to nature is self-evident. She remains blissfully unaware of her true power, but that’s only a matter of time. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Has herbalist training which allows her to make potions, can control plants with her mind, is able to navigate using plant life, and knows the functions of any plants you may encounter] <p/>

![Ysberin](images/R13C1.avif)

### Logan Mya

Logan wants to be a chef. The obelisk island is so diverse, he had hoped to escape the discrimination of his homeland. Unfortunately, it followed him here, making it impossible to find work that didn’t involve violence. He was homeless for a long time, and has decided to take the violent work so he can get the money to open his own bakery. Being a war minotaur, his body couldn’t stop itself being a weapon if he tried. That hefty cock is also a weapon of war, though it leaves opponents covered in a different kind of fluid. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Has super-strength, elite level cooking, martial combat training, and is trustworthy]<p/>

![Logan Mya](images/R13C2.avif)

### Luperios Yiarnomi

Sun elves are those who worshiped an ancient sun deity. Luperios herself is descended from a line of priest kings who served this goddess until she disappeared a millennium ago. Lupeiros was born with more power than even veteran casters, but none of the mastery or control. Unleashing her magic is devastating, but even basic attempts to control it will knock her out cold. She's made the journey in order to weaken her natural magic through the artifacts, of the Obelisk, so that she can train up to her full potential. Outside of this, she puts on a cool, often a bit vain front to disguise just how strung out and scared she is. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Has demigod level magical output, especially in the domains of fire, heat, wind and solar]<p/>

![Luperios Yiarnomi](images/R13C3.avif)

### Gerdir

Crystal goblins aren’t a natural species, having been created by an earth elemental way back in the day. Since then, they’ve proliferated and bounced around the world, looking for or being enslaved by the most powerful magic user of the day. Gerdir is in the employ of one such magician by the name of Lyndra the beautiful. While Gerdir is sarcastic, a bit of a sadist, and fanatically loyal to someone who isn’t you, her talents are clear. Given that you've little interest in money or treasure, you're happy to allow her to take the lion’s share in exchange for her help. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[She’s a trained thief, can store magic in her crystal hair, and extremely durable]<p/>

![Gerdir](images/R13C4.avif)

### Olive Ivo

Summer fae love honor. Like any fae, they're bound to any contract they sign, but summer fae follow the spirit of the thing, not just the letter. Olive was made an offer by a lizard. He would show her a cool trick, and in exchange, Olive would have to be kind to the denizens of this land. He hyped it up so much that Olive had no choice but to sign. The two of you met each other not long after you left the docks, and you explained the situation. She immediately agreed, and you gained her ally-ship. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Low durability in combat, but is immortal, can fly, has heat magic, and can use imprecise teleportation]<p/>

![Olive Ivo](images/R13C5.avif)

### Mello Sliver

You don’t know what Mello is, and all she’ll say is that she’s a party planner for the dead. She goes around to big graveyards and sets up a outrageous event to celebrate their lives. She only throws these once a year, so as to “keep it special”. This year, she has her sights set on the tower. With how many corpses are littered across its levels, it’ll be the biggest party she’s ever thrown. She just needs some help to get to the top. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Has zero combat experience. She is an elite cook, keeps the group’s items clean and functional, can always find fresh water, can walk on walls, and doesn’t sleep] <p/>

![Mello Sliver](images/R13C6.avif)

### Sun Aero

Born from the union of a dryad and a human, Sun is the first of her kind. Believing her to be a curse, her mother’s family drove Sun and her father away, sending them to the Obelisk. She wants to go into the obelisk because she’s heard talk of something called “the endless kindness”, a special magic that melts even the coldest, cruelest hearts. She’s a tough, short young woman with a natural talent for nature, magic or otherwise. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Knows a lot about the Obelisk and its dangers, has basic combat training, excellent tracker, crap with weapons, weakened dryad magic]<p/>

![Sun Aero](images/R13C7.avif)

### Larizz Cul

She knows what you are. A baby mosaic wanders into town, and you think she can’t tell? She can smell the emptiness on your soul. She’s a doctor. Not some touchy feely woman of the cloth, nor a tree hugging herbalist. She's got five kinds of knives, all with someone else’s blood on them. But, she can do something very few others can. If you can endure the pain, she can cut out things from your soul. For most, that’s a skill that could kill them. For you and your patchwork soul? That'd mean getting rid of the things you've absorbed you don’t wanna keep. Mind you, every surgery carries risks, so don’t assume it’s a get out of jail free card. Plus, she works for pay. She’s not taking charity cases. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Lots of traditional medical experience, soul surgeon, can handle herself in a brawl] <p/>

![Larizz Cul](images/R13C8.avif)

### Wet Boy

Asapient cube of jelly affectionately named Wet boy. This giant slime is something of a town mascot, what with how friendly and helpful he is. He cannot speak, due to having no mouth, but is able to scribble down notes using his appendages. Given that you’re one of the few who can read, he asked to join your little adventure. He wants to be an adventurer too, to have stories told about his great deeds. He’s the most inexperienced on the list, but makes up for it with boundless enthusiasm. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Flammable, mute and lacking any combat training. Aside from that, completely invulnerable, loyal to a fault, good at taking orders, and literate] <p/>

![Wet Boy](images/R13C9.avif)

### Forged Triplets

These three are inseparable. The world is not kind to artificial life, and these three have felt that for much of their lives. It’s unclear who built them, and you felt it rude to enquirer too closely. They’re a package deal, as the three of them are a capable, if inexperienced unit. What they want from climbing the tower is unclear, but seeing as the three of them are eager to help without pay, you can’t say you care.

Firstis Maela. She's fiercely protective of her family, though is otherwise easily flustered. <p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Passable tower knight, skilled weapon smith, darkness lasers]  <p/>Second is Behoth. He is a worshiper of sex, having spent much of his time in a church brothel. <p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Skilled dancer and distraction, light manipulation, sexual savant]  <p/>Finally, we have Nero. Nero has a cold, calculating logic underpinning his every action. They have no standout abilities, simply a variety of talents picked up from a long career as an unlicensed mix of geneticist, physicist, and magician. 

![Forged Triplets](images/R13C10.avif)

## Items



##  

With your crew assembled, you’re ready to approach the Obelisk and begin your journey. Before you can, you’re stopped by a wizened dwarf, who’d overheard your talks of climbing the tower. He offers you a few items that might be to your taste, with what little money you have left to spend. 

You already have a lot of things you need. Enough food for you and your companions for at least a month, water and water-skins that should keep your hydrated, some rope, an old lantern with plenty of oil, a simple bow and a sword. However, this dwarf’s wares glow with magic, and you feel you’d be stupid to walk away without taking a look. 

## 



### Tower Pills

These pills are made of loose bricks from the Obelisk and the sweat of magic users, all of which is crushed up into an edible pill. They offer a simple benefit. Anyone who ingests one is turned into a futanari. For all intents and purposes, you will appear to be a woman. You won’t become more muscular, but instead lose a bit of fat around your abs, face, arms, and calves to make you more ripped. You’ll also get a massive cock and balls, which will be in front of your pussy. You’ll also be a foot taller than you used to be. These effects are irreversible, but you’re welcome to hand these out to your team. You get one per purchase.

![Tower Pills](images/R16C1.avif)

### Hollowed Weapon

You felt immediately drawn to this one. It appears to be made of bone-white driftwood, but you know better. Even before the dwarf explains, you can tell that this weapon is just like you. It consumes magical weapons. It destroys them, and gains a new form it can transform into, with powers and magic based on the weapon it obliterated. Its space is limited, only able to consume ten magical items, but consuming a weapon will not necessarily gain its drawbacks, as it would if you tried to drain it. The dwarf assures you this weapon is fresh, and all ten slots are available for use. Once the first slot has been filled, the weapon will be bonded to you and will be unusable for anyone else. You can only buy one.

![Hollowed Weapon](images/R16C2.avif)

### Teleport Crystal

A simple little thing, no bigger than a human thumb and the color of sea foam. When pressed against skin, near to a beating heart, it will begin to charge up. After just a few seconds, every living thing in a five foot radius of the crystal will teleport the holder to a place of their choice. It cannot teleport anyone into the Obelisk, only out. It is single use, crumbling after teleporting, and will not teleport anything non-organic like clothes or items. You get two per purchase.

![Teleport Crystal](images/R16C3.avif)

### Noisy Pebble

These four little rocks look like grey pearls, being smooth and shiny. Each one fits perfectly in any ear, not being knocked out unless you want them out. They allow the wearer to communicate with any of the others in the same set at any distance. Only the sounds of the person wearing the pebble are communicated, it doesn’t pick up any noise from the environment at all. You get four per purchase.

![Noisy Pebble](images/R16C4.avif)

### Verti-Compass

No guide, no problem. This compass will help you find the way by always pointing towards the next ascension point. This way, you'll be able to find your way through to the next level relatively quickly, without having to explore and risk danger. However, be warned. Powerful monsters can cause the compass to go on the fritz, directing you towards the creature instead of the way up.

![Verti-Compass](images/R16C5.avif)

### Warding Armor

What appears at first blush to be a set of intimidating full plate armor is actually a symbiote. It will bond to its first wearer, protecting them from any form of curse. The curse will be applied directly to the armor, with you reaping the extra blessings and any positive effects of the cursed being you’ve drained. The armor will change, visually, to reflect whatever curses its protecting you from. The armor has a limit of five curses it can protect you from. Any curse that grants more than ten blessings has a chance to cause the armor to truly come alive with hostile intent. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Roll a D6 when taking draining a cursed being. If evens, the armor stays dormant. If odds, the armor becomes monstrous]<p/>

![Warding Armor](images/R16C6.avif)

### Come to the Obelisk



![Come to the Obelisk]()

## Layer 1



## The Groove



##  

With your companions at your side and your tools in hand, you make the trek out of the village and towards the Obelisk. In only a few short hours, you’re at its doors. The titanic structure looms in your vision, towering so high above you that you cannot crane your neck far enough to see it all. The gigantic doors stand before your party, and with a light tap, they creak open. A vacuum opens up immediately. With a scream, a cry, a yelp, you are all pulled into the darkness of the entryway, and thrust into your adventure.

 <hr style="border: 1px solid #000; margin: 0px 70px;">
When you awake, you do so surrounded by grass. It is far more vibrant and green than the island you just left. Above you tower monolithic trees, coated in vines and stunning green leaves. Around you are the soft chirps and growls of forest life. Prey, predators, and monsters. You have reached the first layer, and your adventure has begun.

## Power



##   

Each level of the Obelisk has its own special atmosphere, its own special power. As a Mosaic, all you have to do is to open yourself up, to let this power fill you, to gain new abilities.

## 



### Tame

You know the monsterborne respect those who defeat them. The few junglers you've met thus far have told you that much. You wonder why. You open your body up, and allow the air of level one inside you. In an instant, you feel yourself filled with power. It feels innate. Something has been added to your potential Mosaic abilities. Instead of absorbing your stunned foes, you can instead subjugate them. Their willpower is bound to yours. This tether isn’t too strong. If you mistreat your new charge too much, there will be consequences. However, there is a magical respect and desire to serve that you can now tap into. Just like you can’t fuse with something you've drained, you cannot Tame something you've used a different Mosaic ability on.

![Tame](images/R23C1.avif)

## Threads



##  

The first layer is not one to pull its punches. The air is humid, like breathing in a brick. The creature’s around you want you dead, and you’|l have to tread lightly. The only benefit to this place is that the truly hostile creatures are rare. Most will leave you alone if you do the same to them, and it’s thus possible to avoid danger altogether if you travel the right way. However, there are a few threats to look out for.

## 



### Junglers

Former climbers that have decided to stay on this layer and make a life for themselves. As this is the hospitable layer, it attracts those who wish to cast off society. There are six main tribes that rule this place, with smaller tribes scattered about. Each of these main tribes has a special contest that outsiders can enter to gain their favor. Whether that means safe passage or entry into the tribe is up to the contestant, but the contest itself is one of bloodshed, have no doubt about that. Of course, if you don’t look too tough, they may just attempt to kill you to steal your things. If you don’t seek out the help of at least three tribes, you’re unlikely to make it to the final test, which you'll need to ascend to the next layer.

![Junglers](images/R26C1.avif)

### Monsters

These creatures are not born in the traditional way. Instead, they come about as physical manifestations of concepts. Pestilence, rage, growth, soil, and so on. Some say it’s their job to keep the balance of the Obelisk intact, by ridding it of foreign entities. Whatever their reason for doing it, these things will try to kill you basically on sight. They have both their heft and their magic to achieve this goal. Even the smallest of them is twice the size of a human, and they keep growing. They don’t die of old age, they just grow and grow. Though, if you hack off a few bits, they'll go for a high price back on the island and in the world at large.

![Monsters](images/R26C2.avif)

### Monsterborne

Monsterborne are very different to the creature’s they share a name with. They have a humanoid appearance, while still having all the powers and abilities of their monstrous counterparts, as well as having a few visual similarities. Young ones are the same size as human children, but they will quickly grow to reach the same size as their monster cousins. Because of their bridge between the natural and the human, they are highly valued and revered by the Junglers. With the same natural life span as monsters, they can grow into terrifying forces of nature, while also benefiting from the intelligence of humanoids.

![Monsterborne](images/R26C3.avif)

## Friendly Faces



##  

As you and your party move through this place, you make a few friends. These people can offer you aid, but won’t come with you to the next level. None of them would be against a bit of sexy fun before you leave, though. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Pick what you can afford]<p/>

## 



### Silvy Synphia

Silvy is an oldie, though you wouldn’t be able to tell by looking at her. Her growth, far from the titanic monsters her species match, is a bit stunted. Her snake half is barely ten meters long, making her a bit of a runt. She’s had to rely on her social aptitude, becoming a charismatic nomad. When you bump into her, she'll want entertainment and a bit of food. If you can offer that, she’ll be more than happy to help your party. She acts as a translator, and has a variety of friends across the layer. She’s also a good guide, knowing the safe areas better than anyone else.

![Silvy Synphia](images/R29C1.avif)

### The Merchant

You bumped into this strange little creature along a well-worn path. They popped out of nowhere, as if the air itself birthed them. They did not give you a name, and you did not bother to ask for one. They had a variety of things for sale. The mundane things, like food, water, and extra rope were quickly added to your packs, restocking what was missing. Then, they revealed greater treasures. Things they'd found on higher levels. You had many questions, but you held your tongue. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[In an update, meeting this character will allow you to purchase an artifact from later levels early for double the price]<p/>


![The Merchant](images/R29C2.avif)

### Quilian

You knew about this one. How could you not? An ancient dragon, the size of many mountains stacked behind one-another. A beast so powerful that its fury could only be likened to a hurricane, that breathes. Some suspected that it had been there longer than the tower itself, that it was the progenitor of all monsterkind. What you have found is a beast that meets all such descriptions, bar one. It is docile, and kind. You found one of its eyes, which at first you had mistaken for a cliff face. It does not move much, lest it destroy the layer, but it had some sage wisdom for you and your team. It taught you the beauty of the storm, and a single piece of ancient magic. 
<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Take one of the Targets for free, and gain immunity to a single natural disaster you run into]<p/>

![Quilian](images/R29C3.avif)

## Quests



##  

Your new friends, and a few others, need some stuff done for them. If you can complete these quests, you'll get an interesting reward. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Roll a D20 for any quest you want to attempt. Below a ten, you fail. You can’t try again. Above a ten, you succeed, and get whatever’s promised. If you roll a nineteen or a twenty, you get the prize and a bonus of 5 extra blessings]<p/>

## 



### Threasure Hunt

On your journey, you've come across several abandoned towns, choked with vines and overgrowth. As you walk through one such ruin, your foot caught on a scrap of paper that turned out to be a treasure map. If your cartography skills are up to snuff, it will take you all the way to an island. After a lot of digging, you'll find a small bag with “Womb of the Unborn Goddess” scrawled on it. Within it is your reward, a Bone Idol Necklace. It has the ability to manipulate pregnancies however the user wishes. It can cause them, transfer them, speed them up, stop them, undo them, and even multiply the number of kids rocking around in there. The magic protects targets from being hurt by all this. Despite this, you feel that something with such a grand title has more to offer, but you have yet to discover its true nature. Perhaps time will tell.

![Threasure Hunt](images/R32C1.avif)

### Winds of Everything

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[You gain a +5 to complete this quest if you met Quilian] </p>You were told of six wonders of the first layer. A storm under rocks, a tornado made of fire, an endless tsunami, a floating earthquake, a volcano made of ice, and a sun the size of a cricket. In your attempts to find these unnatural phenomena, you will gain a bit of knowledge. This knowledge provides you the ability to summon a powerful elemental monsterborne: a humanoid woman with the powers of the impossible elemental phenomena you have discovered. She will join you as a party member, becoming yet another person who can take things that you fuse, drain, or absorb if you so desire.

### Jungler Fucker

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Requires that you’ve met The Merchant] </p>A couple of rowdy junglers went ahead and stole a bunch of stuff, without even paying! The Merchant can’t offer much beyond a vague description of what these assholes look like, so you'll have to do some tracking. If you can find them, beat them, and return all the stuff that was stolen, the Merchant will happily give you one of their secret items for free. It’s a small package that unfolds into a large tent. This tent keeps anyone inside it magically clean, and those that sleep in it will wake feeling refreshed. The tent is also well camouflaged, making it much safer than camping out on your own. If it’s folded back up with a creature inside it, they'll be propelled out of it like a dog in a catapult.

![Jungler Fucker](images/R32C3.avif)

### A Tribal Path

On your journey, you meet a group of Junglers known as Teachers. They are like a class of scientists, or researchers. Learned people, congregating in one village. It is their job to help other Jungler tribes gain knowledge, by putting pupils through a variety of tasks to make sure pupils through a variety of tasks to make sure they're ready for such gifts. You wish to learn the powers of a shaman, the ability to predict the future. In order to get the symbol of a shaman tattooed upon your skin, you must complete three trials. You must cure a cursed wound, defeat a monster without any weapons except that monster’s body, and repair a piece of higher Obelisk tech without knowing its purpose. Once you complete these tasks, you gain the shaman’s power. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[With the Shaman’s power, you can reroll up to two dice rolls per level of the Obelisk]</p>

### Overflow

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Requires that you've met Silvy Synphia]</p>There’s a volcano that’s been going off for some time near Silvy’s home. Instead of lava, it was ejecting this yellow ooze. She was able to escape in time, but it’s been turning every plant, animal, monster, and monsterborne into golem creatures. Encased in stone, and unable to think for themselves. These creatures move perfectly in sync, as if controlled by some central intelligence. However, if you're able to plug the mountain, all these creatures and plants will return to normal. This will also save Silvy’s family, and she'll be so grateful she'll give you the MutaGenic Butterfly. TI shiny rock allows you to turn any outside creature into a monsterborne. It also lets you turn any monster into a monsterborne, but requires a bit of effort. <p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Roll a D20. If you get above a 15, a monster is turned into a monsterborne]</p>

![Overflow](images/R32C5.avif)

### Insemination

As you and your party make your way through this layer, you hear stories about a terrible group of Junglers. They don’t have a formal name, but they're ruled by a priestess who guards the way to the higher layers. The whole group are gigantic futanari who're rumored to drink monster blood to get as big as they are. They go around, breeding other jungler groups and forcing their women to carry their children. The most recent tribe you've come across is currently being attacked, and you have a chance to help! You and your party dash in, beating back these rape-happy attackers before they can hurt anyone. Once complete, the grateful junglers of this, rescued tribe offer up a magic mirror. It can turn any monsterborne into a regular person, but only temporarily. So if you defeat someone as a human, then you could wait for them to turn back to a monsterborne to absorb their more interesting traits. Additionally, you've gained experience with fighting against the Priestesses minions, which will help later.

![Insemination](images/R32C6.avif)

## Rivals



##  

Friends aren’t the only beings you’re likely to find. Even in a tower of magic and terror, the pettiness of humanoids still finds a way to make a nuisance. These ones cannot be defeated, and thus won’t be possible to absorb. They’re just obstacles you'll have to deal with on the way to your true goal. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Pick as many as you like to gain back some blessings]<p/>

### Daldama

A gibbering lunatic. You’re not even sure how someone this incompetent made their way in here, let alone survived this long. Others have said they fell all the way down from “Heaven”, but that can’t possibly be true. Their one “power” seems to be that nothing can hurt them when they’re horny. They use this exclusively to try to cuck new climbers. They’ll dive to fuck any given monster, monsterborne, or jungler you try to fuck in your time here. They can obviously be beaten back, but that only does so much. Once they get their claws, there’s not much that can throw them off.

![Daldama](images/R35C1.avif)

### Magnus Hvitserksson

Magnus isn’t so much cruel as self-interested. She'll hide in the shadows of a tree, watch your party take their reward, then swoop in and steal whatever she can. Money, valuables, tools, etc. She’ll only take things that you just got, rather than anything you came in with. She uses her electro-magnetism to make it easier to snatch up valuables. In a straight fight, she’s nothing special, which is why she operates on a snatch and run policy. If none of your party really cares about valuables, she’s not an issue. But if anyone is looking to get paid, Magnus becomes infuriating.

![Magnus Hvitserksson](images/R35C2.avif)

## Targets



##  

Like the jaw of a snake, you feel your soul curl open. So many powerful creatures, ripe for defeat and absorption. You begin to hunt. You and your crowd look around for whatever you can, spying some curious creatures you're sure your team can defeat. If you do, the powers of each beast are yours to have.

Correct blessings for Absorb

## Artifacts



##  

In heading towards the second layer, you’ve found all kinds of knick knacks. Most were junk, barely distinguishable from the bark of nearby trees. Others were useful in ways you could understand. However, there are a few you found that made your soul swirl, desperate for a taste of what you hold in your hands. However, try as you might, your Mosaic powers couldn’t interact with these objects. They glow with an unknown, arcane power, and even though you can’t make them a part of you, their value is still impressive. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Pick as many as you can afford]<p/>

## 



### Soulwood Handle

A gleaming wooden handle that can turn a piece of skin, hide, or bone from a monster into a magnificent blade that it will then be attached to. The newly created blade will have magical properties based on the monster it was. taken from. For example, a dragon might make the whole sword fireproof and give the blade itself greater cutting power. At any time, the handle can create a new blade from new materials, replacing the old one. The old blade won't turn back into animal parts, and will instead dissolve into nothing.

![Soulwood Handle](images/R44C1.avif)

### Obsidian Knife

This artifact can channel fire magic into itself to augment its action, cooking food as it chops or cauterizing wounds as it cuts. It may be dull with time, and can be repaired by being dipped in lava. While its powers are enduring, it does not function as well in cold weather.

![Obsidian Knife](images/R44C2.avif)

### Hoops of Cambria

These are two glass hoops. Each can create magical seawater that has different effects. The first hoop makes a creature more primal (stronger, more animalistic, less intelligent), and the second makes them more sophisticated (weaker, more humanoid, more intelligent). Dumping this seawater onto a creature also coats them in barnacles and seaweed. These hoops must be laid under the light of a full moon to recharge, and will need to be recharged after every ten uses.

![Hoops of Cambria](images/R44C3.avif)

### Dreamwalkers Flute

When played, this flute puts all who can hear it to sleep, excluding the user. This magical sleep will be full of erotic dreams. The sleep it causes lasts eight hours, and nothing can bring a creature out of sleep before that time is up. The flute itself sounds like an ethereal, wailing voice, and using it too many times in a row will put the user to sleep.

![Dreamwalkers Flute](images/R44C4.avif)

### Jar of Purity

An artifact that, when opened, shrinks and pulls in any nearby unconscious creatures. The artifact can hold six such creatures. Once the artifact fills up, or after a few hours, all the creatures within will wake up and begin to fight until only one remains. The creature that wins the fight inside the artifact will gain features, powers, and benefits from all other slain creatures, but will revert to a child form with no memories of its previous life. Creatures created by this brutal act are very trusting of the one who put them in the artifact

![Jar of Purity](images/R44C5.avif)

### War Horn

When this artifact is blown, all those around the blower will be divided into two camps. Those the blower trusts, and those the blower doesn’t. All those the blower trusts will become fearless, stop feeling pain, and will become very aggressive towards the other group. Those the blower doesn’t trust will become terrified and will feel far more pain than normal. Blowing the horn for more than a straight minute will cause the blower to burst into flames.

![War Horn](images/R44C6.avif)

### Trident of Tundra

This artifact can be used to summon and command up to twenty ice constructs, all shaped like beautiful women. When the trident itself is used to kill something, all the ice constructs it has created will become bigger and repair any damage they've suffered. Prolonged usage of this artifact causes the surrounding air to get colder and colder until it freezes everything solid.

![Trident of Tundra](images/R44C7.avif)

### Living Star

Monsters avoid this artifact, but monsterborne are drawn to it. This artifact has seemingly unlimited energy, and can be used to power anything. Magical energy, electricity, heat, whatever is needed. However, the other properties of this artifact are unknown.

![Living Star](images/R44C8.avif)

## Bosses



##  

You stand here. With the second layer in sight. Before you is a monster, one of two you chose to fight. If you do not defeat them, you will not be able to ascend. You ready yourself, and your party. You charge forward, hoping to strike the monster down. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Roll a D20. On a 15 or higher, you win, and may pass to the next level. On a 6 to 14, you will fail, and need to try again. On a five or lower, you will fail, and you must pick one of the things you’ve drained, fused, or absorbed so far. Whatever you choose will then be added to that boss. You can only beat one boss.]<p/>

## 



### Changing Lord

 The most recent monsterborne to rule this floor. A giantess with a power you'll be none too foreign to. It can take from other creatures to further add to themselves. This being is obsessed with the idea of adding every single species to itself and rising to the rank of goddess. 

• Feared and respected by all beings in the first layer. 

• This creature can absorb a single other creature into its body without needing to defeat it. 

• Has an intuitive understanding of all the other races and species of the Obelisk 

• Has a strong motherly instinct and a desire to sire more children 

• Cannot die of old age as long as they keep absorbing more creatures

![Changing Lord](images/R47C1.avif)

### Pristess Ngalutah

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[You gain a +2 to your roll if you completed the Insemination quest] </p>The futanari priestess. She descended from the higher layers, claiming to be the true envoy of spirits beyond. She has convinced her flock that they have the true genes, and must inseminate all others in an attempt to dominate the world through their spawn. She says that she came down to the first layer willingly, but it's clear she was cast out for her insane beliefs. 

• Commands several dozen fervent, magically souped up futanari junglers.

• Able to inspire religious fervor in those who listen to her for long enough. 

• Nine feet tall, with a grip like steel.

• Has powerful spiritual magic that allows her to astral project into and near her companions/allies. 

• Can cum and cum and cum loads of virile spunk, and can only temporarily relieve her libido when she gets someone pregnant.

![Pristess Ngalutah](images/R47C2.avif)

### Fascinating Pet

A creature the size of a football that met your party not long after you entered. It was sweet and friendly, acting like a misshapen dog. However, as your party approached the exit that would lead to the next layer, it grew. Steadily, and slowly. By the time you arrived, it had grown to the size of a draft horse, and looked a lot less cute. It was then that you realized it had been studying you, learning what you and your team were capable of. It will now wield that understanding against you. 
 
• This creature can change its size, shrinking down to a fraction or expanding to the size of a house.

• It has many favors it has earned from other monsters on this layer, and can call them in as needed.

• It can produce a pacifying aura that makes people think of it as a lovable pet.

• Could cannibalize a member of its own species without any ill effects physically or mentally.

## Layer 2



## The Burn Pits



##  

With the boss of the first layer handily defeated, you and your team begin to make their trek upwards. As you enter, the wave of heat is the first thing any of you notice. Your eyes water, struggling to even see through the molten air. The leaves and vines that cling to your boots turn yellow and peel away. Eventually, the heat pulls you to your knees. You have entered the land of endless volcanoes, magma, and burning, the second layer. 

 <hr style="border: 1px solid #000; margin: 0px 70px;">
When you wake up, you find yourself clad in strange robes. They’re soft, despite looking visibly scratchy and frayed. Your companions are a few feet away, dressed the same way. Now that you can see properly, you spot a handful of landmarks. To the south, you see towering mountains, shaped like the fingers of some grasping god. To the east, there’s a small hill coated in a series of compounds. A little ways to the north, within walking distance, you see a bag. Made of rough leather from an unknown animal, and the approximate size and shape of a human head. You look through it, finding your entire party’s supplies, items, equipment and clothes.

## Base Powers



##  

You know what you can do. You are a Mosaic, and no matter what happens, you will always have these abilities. In quiet moments, as you ascend each layer, you remind yourself of these powers. It steadies you. Gives you comfort.

##  



### Drain

From the lowliest insect, to the greatest of gods, all beings can be described. Their history can be condensed into a few grand moments, their greatest skill can be evidenced, and their power laid bare. You will take their description. You will take what lies below the surface. You will leave them without these qualities. No memory of who they are, no power, and no skill. Wiped clean, and left to grow in new ways.

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[When applied, all the features of a creature/item listed out in dot points will be yours. All of them]</p>

![Drain]()

### Fuse

Your soul cries out for something. Not power, but beauty. This gives you the chance to wear the form of your fallen foe. You do not rip their face from them, as Drain rips away their past. Instead, you merely copy it. You are a Mosaic, after all. But you can only take what is revealed to you. Only gain what you can see. So be careful in your observation.

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[When applied, you will gain a copy of the creature or item’s form. You may turn into it, at any time, and perform any action or use any power that you can see or reasonably glean from the image attached to the option. So if they’re just sitting there with a witch’s hat, you could probably assume they can brew potions. However, you cannot make any assumptions based on their description, only what you see]</p>

![Fuse]()

### Absorb

Your soul is desperate to be filled. You must unleash your true power. This lets you take anything from your foe. Their history will rewrite your own. Their strength will become yours so completely that it will feel as if you always had it. Your face will not be the one you were born with, but the one you chose to have. These are not simply benefits, not simply tools. They become immutable parts of your very existence. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[You may choose any combination of description and picture to apply to yourself. You don’t need to take everything. You can take only one dot point, and apply only one part of their picture to yourself if you want. However, doing this costs twice as many blessings as normal]</p>

![Absorb]()

### Cultivation

The heat of this place, it’s almost unbearable without this strange cloak. But as your body sweats like it’s never sweated before, you feel something change. Magic exists in all things, created from the soul and spilling out into the wider world. But here, your muscles are clenched so tight, and your body is under so much strain, that the magic turns inwards. It's a slow, slow process, but every time you ascend to a new level of the Obelisk, three stats of your choice will increase by one.

![Cultivation](images/R54C4.avif)

## Threads



##  

Strangely, this layer contains very little that is natural. All the living threats are from outsiders who have come in and taken root in this place. It seems as if this layer, without proper protection, is too hostile to life for anything to have come before. Luckily, you are protected, and you just have to worry about everyone else.

##  



### Cultivators

This layer is like a forge. Weakness is stripped away, and destroyed. Many incredibly strong people have discovered that this place can make them even stronger. They seek physical and magical power, but the heat of this place has corrupted their minds. They act like addicts, desperate for the next high of power, and will smash apart anything they come across in service of demonstrating their new abilities.

![Cultivators](images/R57C1.avif)

### Qi Beast

Many scientists and researchers have attempted to bring life to layer two, to populate this place such that travelers have some source of food in this barren wasteland. As kind-hearted as this goal was, it has ended in failure. These animals, the ones that survived, were forged into things both inedible and unstoppable. Gigantic beasts of roiling muscle, without face or features, who's only desire is carnage.

![Qi Beast](images/R57C2.avif)

### Bandits

The desperate and the hungry. They're not strong enough to remove their protections without dying, nor are they able to progress any further. They have formed small tribes and villages, trying any option they can to live in this unkind plane. They hunt travelers, seeking to steal whatever they can that might let them survive just one more day. Thanks to the heat and their own weakness, they cannot masturbate, and are constantly fighting through feelings of intense sexual frustration. Perhaps it's why they have become so myopic.

![Bandits](images/R57C3.avif)

## Friendly Faces



##  

As you and your party move through this arid place, you find new friends. These people can offer you aid, but won’t come with you to the next level. None of them would be against a bit of sexy fun before you leave though. 

##  



### Welqei

Don’t let her appearance deceive you, she’s almost 300 years old. For as long as she can remember, she has sought to find a way to defeat her mother, the Demon Lord of this layer. You can see in her eyes that she's suffering from that same power-madness that the cultivators are. She can’t even seem to remember why she hates her father so much. Even still, her mind is clearly made of stern enough stuff to keep her from hurting you all. She'll be more than happy to help you find some artifacts on this layer, as they may help her get closer to her ultimate goal. 
<span style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Roll a D20. If it’s a 15 or higher, you get an artifact from this level for free]<span/>

![Welqei](images/R60C1.avif)

### Zeito Applebloom

She wants to leave this layer. She's the most reasonable person you've come across who's spent more than a month here. She'll happily join your party, she just wants to get away. She’s a mean motherfucker too, having a mastery of three different forms of hand to hand combat, and a familiarity with another dozen. She's also never lost a one on one fight, even against magical or monstrous opponents. Whether that’s because she doesn’t pick fights she can’t win, or because she’s a tactical genius is something you'll soon find out.

![Zeito Applebloom](images/R60C2.avif)

### Wackhec Acorn

Once of the researchers who brought animals to this layer, all those decades ago. Her team has since been eaten or escaped, leaving only her. She's not very strong, and has gone a little bit crazy from heatstroke. Despite this, she’s still sharp, inquisitive, and understands the dangers of this layer better than anyone. She wants your help to ascend the rest of the Obelisk, and keeps talking about portals and alternate dimensions.

![Wackhec Acorn](images/R60C3.avif)

## Quests



##  

Travelling across such a desperate layer puts you in contact with a lot of desperate people. If you can complete their quests, you'll be rewarded. 
 
<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Roll a D20 for any quest you want to attempt. Below a ten, you fail. You can’t try again. Above a ten, you succeed, and get whatever’s promised. If you roll a nineteen or a twenty, you get the prize and a bonus of 5 extra blessings]<p/>

## 



### Quest!

A strange, adorable creature with a toddler’s grasp on language has offered you a quest. It’s achingly boring, with you and your merry band traipsing laps across this boiling land in search of what the creature wants. Its instructions are also not very good, leading you to getting a lot of different things that aren’t right before you finally stumble onto what you're after. If you're successful, the creature offers you a necklace with a wooden sword drawn on it. This means that if you drain the Keratin stone, you'll be able to control the growth of your new spikes, having them appear and vanish on any part of your body.

![Quest!](images/R63C1.avif)

### Zeito Applebloom

A pack of bandits got their hands on an alchemist. They didn’t realize what they were doing, and uncorked a bunch of reagents. This resulted in a purple explosion so massive your party saw it from miles out. When you arrived, abominations were wandering around. They appeared to be guarding the now very dead bandits, who still had some good stuff on them. If you’re willing and able to defeat them, you'll get your hands on something labelled a “Unity pitcher”. The alchemist’s notes say that this can turn any object into a powerful, friendly creature that bonds with the one who created it.

![Zeito Applebloom](images/R63C2.avif)

### Wackhec Acorn

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Requires that you took Zeitio Applebloom] </p>You and Zeito fucking hate each other. Your first meeting started on the wrong foot, and you've been tap-dancing down an escalator ever since. The rest of your team had to convince you to let her join. One morning, she comes to you to settle things. She challenged you to a fight. No weapons, no magic, nothing. If she wins, she takes over from you. If she loses, she accepts your authority. When you do win, you find her to be instantly more respectful, and even offers up a personal treasure, the World Orb. It allows a person to find their one true love, no matter where they may be.

![Wackhec Acorn](images/R63C3.avif)

### Elemental Kerfuffle

Some fucking idiot tried to unleash the spirits of the ocean, in the volcano layer. Needless to say, it’s causing an unbelievable amount of toxic smoke, acid rain, and flooding. What was already a hostile place is now resembling the surface of Venus. You can either get the fuck out of this layer ASAP, or round up the spirits and stuff them back into their coral pods. If you choose the latter and succeed, you'll bury them deep underground. All but one, which you keep. Now, anytime you like, you can unleash a single spirit to instantly turn an area into a lake. It’s tough to control, so don’t leave it open too long.

![Elemental Kerfuffle](images/R63C4.avif)

### Treasure Hunt

As you walk through the ruins of an ancient cultivators “house”, you find another treasure map. If your cartography skills are up to snuff, it will take you all the way to the largest volcano. After a bit of digging and dodging lava, you'll find a stone sphere with “Style of the Unborn Goddess” etched on it. Cracking it open reveals your reward, a stone ring. It has a three tiered lotus flower edged onto its surface. It has the power of aesthetics, allowing it to create or enhance any kinds of clothes on its wearer. It cannot grant true power, for it can’t create magical clothes, but if you want armor that transforms into a gown, it can do it. Despite this, you feel that something with such a grand title has more to offer, but you have yet to discover its true nature. Perhaps time will tell.

![Treasure Hunt](images/R63C5.avif)

### Auction Madness

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Requires that you take Wachek Acorn]</p>Wachek explains that there’s a yearly auction, at the dead center of the layer. Every single bandit comes to try and sell the things they’ve stolen, in hopes of getting their hands on food and water. She explains that one of her pieces of technology was stolen, and is likely to be sold in the auction. It’s called the infinite spring, a gigantic collar that works as a belt for most people. When worn, it feeds and hydrates any creature forever. Nobody but Wachek knows how worthwhile it actually is, so it’s a race to get the thing back before they find out what it does. It’s so damn powerful it could easily spark a war, and nobody wants that.

![Auction Madness](images/R63C6.avif)

## Rivals



##  

Friends are rare in a place like this, but rarer still are people who hate you personally. Ironic though it may seem, most people are too scared or desperate to hold grudges. So if people are out for your blood, it must be for a really special reason. No matter what you do, these people cannot be defeated, and thus won’t be possible to absorb, only avoided. 
 
<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Pick as many as you like to gain back some blessings]<p/>

##  



### Nidral

Sealed to this layer by an unknown sect, Nidral has long since lost most of her power and former stature. Her powers only allow her to manipulate small items. Ball bearings, arrows, small birds, and insects. Even then, she can only move them backwards or forwards a few seconds at a time. She retains the ability to revert to a younger version of herself whenever she’s killed though, making her immortal but not terribly dangerous. She believes you can help her, but her nature as a manipulator means that she can’t simply ask for your aid. She’s selfish, cruel, and utterly incapable of telling a truth that wouldn’t suit her.

![Nidral](images/R66C1.avif)

### Clifford Poisonwood

A traveller, same as you. Clifford was separated from his party, who were on track to get to the fifth level. Your first meetings with Clifford found him to have already been taken by some of the traits of the cultivators and the bandits. He also believes that his is a curse, and if he can pass the curse onto another, he’ll be freed. So if he can strand you on this layer, away from your team, he will be able to move on.

![Clifford Poisonwood](images/R66C2.avif)

## Targets



##  

Once again, your soul uncoils in the presence of the creatures around you. So many powerful creatures, ripe for defeat and absorption. You and your crowd look around for whatever you can, spying some curious creatures and strange items you’re sure your team can defeat. With every conquest, these powers are added to your own.

• This item has potent sexual luck. Every encounter it has tends to be with someone beautiful or sexually interesting. 

• This luck extends to actions, making any interaction far more likely to result in sex of some kind. 

• The particular desires of the people do not necessarily change. If they have bad intentions for this object, they may beat it and then have sex with it, or kill it and fuck its corpse.

• When she pushes her body to the absolute limit, to the point where her power and skills plateau, she will violently explode 

• After the explosion, her consciousness will reconstitute. It will build a new, stronger body that can be pushed even further. It still takes work to get to the new plateau, though. 

• One of her eyes is partially blind. She’s been unable to find a way to make it stronger, so it remains shitty even as the rest of her body gets better.

• It is said that this mouse is older than all other creatures on this level, that it has been around for thousands of years. And in that time, it has become so filled with the spirit of survival and fire elemental that it is now probably the strongest mouse in the world that even huge monsters fear.

• It is living proof that if you get stronger every day, you will never get weaker. Never. Just a few minutes of exercise a day and you won't lose strength and skills, you'll only develop further.

• She has the ability to manipulate electricity. She can’t produce enormous bolts of lightning, but she can replicate the effect of an electric fence on her skin. 

• Her abilities, when used on magical items, improves them even further. It's as if she gave them a motor, or some other electrical attachment, just by holding them. 

• A lighter version of this can be used to electrify someone's genitals, which prevents them from cumming. 

- This effect will short-circuit demonic items, making them next to useful. It also destroys corruption from items, which can be bad depending on what makes the item powerful.

• These madmen were so obsessed with the desire to fight that not even death could stop them. Their fiery rage propelled them forward even with mortal wounds, even as their flesh burned they continued to fight, and when their bones turned to ashes, the flames themselves became their bodies. 

The berserk rage allowed them to surpass their limits, but it also completely robs them of their minds in battle so that they attack everyone indiscriminately.

The in corporeality allow them to avoid many attacks without even noticing them, and the flames deal additional damage.

Correct blessings for Absorb

## Cursed beings



##  

Your soul recoils at the touch of these creatures. They are beings whose bodies and powers would not help you, but instead slow you down. Perhaps some have some scant benefit, but it is lost amid a tidal wave of issues, drawbacks, and frustrations. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[You may take as many as you like. Draining them gives blessings, fusing costs that many blessings, and Absorb costs double that many blessings]<p/>

• He gained a trait from every single person who respected him.

• He used to be able to choose what that trait would be, but he has since lost that art. The traits are random, some bad and some good. 

• People who found him attractive before getting to know him properly would idolize him, being unable to see or accept who he truly was.

• Instead of aging, she became more feminine with time. Any traits associated with femininity, like breast size or a high-pitched voice, would increase. 

• This effect would feed off the societal attitudes of wherever she happened to be, so if she lived in a dwarf camp for long enough, she'd grow a beard. 

• This curse is so powerful that it also affects any of her descendants, even if they’re born male.

• Anyone who gets physical pleasure from this object will slowly become more demonic, both physically and mentally. 

• This corruption is semi-permanent, though it requires long periods of distance from the object for the changes to revert. 

• This corruption pushes people to indulge in their basic instincts and desires, making them impulsive and reckless.

• This creature cannot grow any hair below its neck. Not so much as a stray pube or leg hair.

• Every inch of hair that should grow or exist below the neck now grows above the head. This means that its head and facial hair grows at enhanced rates, to the point of looking like a front facing tail.

• This creature does not get irritated or uncomfortable with hair being in its face, nose, or mouth.

• The entire object is pink in various shades. At least 70% of its surface is such a bright pink that it’s almost impossible to hide it. 

• If this object comes into contact with any kind of cum, it will make that cum much more viscous and sticky. The cum will also taste and smell like this object. 

• It tastes sweeter than any other food one could find, even sweeter than actual sugar. Its taste is prized for that reason.

• It grows horns at an alarming rate. Tusks, horns, spines, the works. All strong, sturdy, and tough. 

• Attempting to shave down the horns will work temporarily. Cutting them off will stop their growth in that area, but cause them to grow out of a new area instead.

• If the stone had things like nails or teeth, those would grow too, sharpening into fangs and claws.

• Every point she has in every other stat doesn’t just increase the size of her various parts, but also increases the length of her legs as if it were a point of dexterity. Without making her more dexterous.

• Her feet feel really uncomfortable if she’s not wearing at least four-inch heels.

• Her thighs are outrageously soft.

• Any magical, non-weapon object that touches this item will transform into a dildo with the same magical properties. 

• The resulting dildo needs to be inserted into a living creature’s body for its magic to work. 

• The item itself has incredible elasticity, allowing it to stretch and hold hundreds of dildos at a time.

• This creature tastes fantastic. You'll find few animals that you could start chewing without plucking, cooking, or seasoning that taste this good. 

• Any predator it comes into contact can tell how good it tastes just by looking at it.

• Smarter beings, like people, may be able to resist the urge to eat it, especially if they have some bond with the creature. Wild animals do not.

• It is possible for this item to gain or have points in strength. Such points allow it to propel arrows much further.

• However, for every point of strength this item has, it becomes 100% more sensitive to all kinds of physical pleasure. 

• This sensitivity increase affects both the item and anyone who is touching the item, making it quite difficult to focus on other things.

• She has endless sexual stamina, with no refractory period to speak of. As long as she’s fucking, she could stay awake and alert forever. 

• Any kind of sexual arousal or stimuli will not stop having an effect on her until she cums. This means that once she gets horny, she won’t be able to get unhorny without orgasms. 

• Every pregnancy she conceives has at least two children, and often as many as four.

• They appear totally uninteresting. No-one who view them will view them as anything of interest 

• This feeling of malaise is so strong that nobody will hate them or grow angry with them, but nobody will love them or find them beautiful. People may even struggle to recognize them. 

• They are out of place nowhere, but this means they are not exceptional in anyone’s mind or heart.

Correct blessings for Absorb

![]()

## Artifact



##  

In heading through the arid land of the second layer, you’ve found all kinds of knick knacks. Most were junk, barely distinguishable from the bark of sand underfoot, or cursed to the point of violence. However, there are a few that go beyond simple appearances. They glow with an unknown, arcane power, and even though you can’t make them a part of you, their value is still impressive.

##  



### Tortoise Cauldron

A creation that produces endless water. Simply rotate the turtle faces to make the blue flow. But be careful. If too much of the magic water is drunk, it will replicate all sorts of effects. Feelings of dizziness, joy, fuzziness, loose inhibitions, hallucinations, and other things you might associate with a buzz. These effects will never harm or kill a user, although they can be quite intense.

![Tortoise Cauldron](images/R75C1.avif)

### Tiger Armore

Said to have been created from the hide of the snow tiger, an unbelievably powerful Qi beast that fought a dragon to a standstill. It is soft, totally heat and fire-resistant, and cannot be cut by any metals you've ever seen. One wonders how this outfit was even crafted in the first place.

![Tiger Armore](images/R75C2.avif)

### Vermilion Fan

Created from the feathers of a long since dead avian cultivator. It was said she was burned to death mid-flight, in search of hotter volcanoes to train her strength. If flicked in just the right way, it can call forth gusts that could throw about molten stone like it was dandelion fluff. Learning the technique will take some time, though.

![Vermilion Fan](images/R75C3.avif)

### Azure Egg

An egg of unknown origins and with unknown contents. You found it ina sand den that was full to the gills with Qi beasts. They were so corrupted and monstrous that it was impossible to tell what they once were. The egg is covered in the language of dragons. Perhaps you can find a translator on your journey.

![Azure Egg](images/R75C4.avif)

### Immortal Manual

This tome can collect any spell it bears witness to, storing it away to be cloned later. The book has no limits on the number or nature of these spells, but it's blank when you find it. Additionally, casting each spell requires a long and unique sex act to be performed. Cumming at any point while using the book will prevent any spells from being cast for at least two hours.

![Immortal Manual](images/R75C5.avif)

### 1000 Ring

This ring can pull in any non-magical, non-living object into itself, and then release it later. It perfectly preserves things too, so you could store some snacks, and they wouldn’t go off. The ring has a limit of 1000 cubic meters of space. ‚After that limit is reached, the ring won’t work until some things are cleared out. If you attempt to push the ring even after it tries to stop you, the ring will break and everything will fall out.

![1000 Ring](images/R75C6.avif)

### Bountiful Springs

This is not so much an item you carry as one that follows you. In moments of struggle, misery, or desperation, the spring will appear. It has a deep pool of water, beautiful plants, anda perfect temperature once stepped into. It is a place that allows for rest, and may even offer magical ingredients for use in potions. Once you and your party have had your fill and step out, the spring will shimmer into nothingness once more until you need it again.

![Bountiful Springs](images/R75C7.avif)

### Weight of Carma

A simple band of metal. It's painted gold, but it's just steel. When placed on someone's head, it cannot be removed by anyone but the person who placed it. If the person tries to do something the placer does not want them to do, they will receive a powerful, paralyzing electric shock. Even a god cannot resist this effect, if you can get it on their head.

## Bosses



##  

You stand here. With the third layer just within reach. Before you is a monster, one you must fight to progress. You ready yourself, and your party. This will not be easy. 

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[Roll a D20. On a 15 or higher, you win, and may pass to the next level. On a 6 to 14, you will fail, and need to try again. On a five or lower, you will fail, and you must pick one of the things you’ve drained, fused, or absorbed so far. Whatever you choose will then be added to that boss. You can only beat one boss.] </p>

##  



### Zun Li

A master martial artist and cultivator, Zun Li has reached the pinnacle of what this layer can provide, but she can not leave until she finds a successor or is defeated. Let's see if you have even a fraction of what it takes. 
   
• Every single win in physical combat makes her stronger. The gains are small on their own, but add up over time. 

• Her thighs are so powerful that if she flexes them at just the right time, she can deflect spells. 

• She speaks five languages and has a skill for learning more, but has an incredibly thick accent no matter what she’s saying.

• Being in physical combat makes her incredibly horny, but she believes that the longer she holds off from masturbating, the more effective of a fighter she'll be.

![Zun Li](images/R78C1.avif)

### Silk

<p style="color:#5100b2;text-align: center;">[You gain a +2 to your roll if you have Welgei on your side]</p> A demon who stumbled ass-backwards into the rank of demon lord, and has been thriving on this layer. Given its striking similarities to hell, she and her underlings have been doing quite well. Her main goals are not as grandiose as her title, with her desires mostly centering around feminizing everything she can get her hands on. 
 
• She can turn any living creature into a hyper-sexualized female version of itself 

• She has a retinue of fem-demons that do as she commands. They're rubbish in a fight, but make great distractions 

• She can create localized explosions of magma within 100 meters of herself 

• She finds the male form to be disgusting, feeling ill whenever she sees it

![Silk](images/R78C2.avif)

### Dinkai Forest

Something few have attempted and even fewer have succeeded at is uniting all the bandit tribes under one banner. Well Dinkai is pretty close. Running what can only be described as a mob operation, they have a network of thieves, spies, and bodyguards spanning across the whole layer. 
 
• They have an intuitive sense of what other people want, whether from them, or from life in general.

• They can disguise their true form, to the point where not even magic, unconsciousness, or truth telling drugs could pull it forth. 

• They have access to a vast collection of powerful weapons that they can summon forth at any time. Only they can use them, though, they can't be handed off to an ally or subordinate.

• If they’re reminded that they are an animal, they will fly into a maddening rage for many hours.

![Victory!]()

##   

<p></p>With each step, you could feel the air getting colder. When the lava and the scalding heat disappeared, you were glad for the coolness you had missed so much. But soon frost covered the bare rocks and frozen piles of lava, and snow appeared in the air, so you began to wrap yourself in warm clothes. Just before passing through to the next level, you came across the tent of a traveling succubus. 

<span style="color: #E73333FF;">"Wait traveler, because of the avalanches the road is too dangerous now. 
The third level is not accessible yet,
 but I will be glad to receive you in my tent..." </span>
