title: Last Days

##  



##  

   You sprint down the street in a state of panic, knocking down passersby who recoil in shock and dismay, but you remain heedless of their protests.  Naive fools, they haven't even realized that the world is falling apart right now, that all their dreams and hopes are crumbling to dust, that they still think they have jobs to go to and important things to do. That they have a home to come back to.

   Your breath comes in ragged gasps, your legs already throbbing with pain, but an all-encompassing fear drives you relentlessly forward until you stumble and collapse to the ground. The pain jolts you into a moment of clarity, but fearful thoughts continue to swirl, tumultuous and uncontrolled. It all happened in the blink of an eye... Not long ago everything was blissfully normal, you were dedicated to the project of your life, blissfully unaware of the news and what's going on in the damn world, and now... Damn it, now even survival until dawn remains uncertain!

   A distant roar and the shaking of the earth interrupts your thoughts, forcing you to rise once more despite your exhausted limbs. You spit out a lump of viscous saliva and survey your surroundings before moving on. In the span of a few hours, the world you once knew has changed so much that you can barely recognize the road you're on...

   You must keep running.

## In what world have you lived your life?



### Fantasy

A world of power and magic, of honorable nobles and fearsome monsters. Not long ago, it had been a prosperous kingdom, the city filled with the delightful scent of flowers and exquisite spices from all corners of the world. But now, the once beautiful scarlet tiles the citizens were so proud of and the pure air had been replaced by ravenous flames and choking black smoke.

### Steampunk

It was a time of great change, with scientific and technological revolutions sweeping the land.  The thrill of adventure beckoned in newly discovered lands, while power shifted in the old world. Annual expositions showcased awe-inspiring new products and inventions, where steaming machinery and gleaming bronze caught the eye.  It was a paradise for inventors and daring scientists, and you were among the best...

### Modern

Years of peace and tranquility have lulled the people into complacency. They have become accustomed to seeing war and bloodshed only on the silver screen. They thought it was nothing more than entertainment and that the worst they could face is a traffic jam, an angry boss, or a dead cell phone battery... But now their lives are shrouded in blood and terror, and the streets echo with the cries of despair.

### Sci-Fi

Prosthetics and cyborgs, AI and space travel, free food for all and a panacea in every first aid kit - all the things humans have dreamed of for centuries are now within reach... But with these advances comes the dark side of slavery to gigacorporations, identity hacking, and the proliferation of dirt-cheap drugs. Everyone here thinks only of themselves and is willing to sink their teeth into anyone's throat without a second thought.

## 

   You were lucky enough to be one of the first to realize the true extent of the disaster. You've always been smart and had an excellent sense of danger, so you didn't hesitate and hope that it was just a nightmare or that everything would go away... No, this is a real apocalypse! The end of the world! Panting from the fast run, you tried once again to review in your mind everything you knew about this catastrophe.

## What has happened to this world?



### Disorder

Amidst the financial crisis, strikes, protests, chaos, and riots, everything spiraled out of control. The world descended into an insane chaos of destruction. Law enforcement and government institutions ceased to exist, just bloodthirsty mobs of bandits and looters burning and destroying everything in their path.

### Starfall

A tiny shift in orbits, a collision in deep space, and now the annual summer stargazing has turned into an apocalypse. The meteor shower has engulfed the entire planet like a carpet bombing. Forests are ablaze, the earth trembles, and there is no chance for shelter.

### Solar Flare

Mankind was unlucky, and the regular starburst was aimed right at Earth. All electronics burned out in the first seconds, leaving people without communication. The skies glow with auroras even during the day, all living things suffer from the harsh radiation, but you know this is just the beginning.

### Shadows

People have always been missing, but now the population of entire cities is disappearing at once. Moreover, they have begun to return as silent, faceless shadows, taking others with them. No one knows exactly what is happening, and even you are unsure. But you know that they will soon come for you.

### Necromancers

The prophecies have warned of this for centuries, but no one has heeded them... Ancient necromancers, gathering power over the millennia, have raised endless legions of the undead and led them into battle against the living. They continue to resurrect the fallen, with each fallen human adding to their ever-growing army.

### Undead

"A new invention that allow to send even dead soldiers into battle to save the blood of the living." Huh. What a magnificent idea and yet such a dreadful mistake. Instead of fighting for the living, they have turned their weapons against them.  The hate-filled undead soldiers have impeccable killing skills and the ability to revive the dead with their own blood.

### Zombie

A military virus, a mutation, or fungal spores? Does it matter what causes the dead to rise and feast on the living? What makes them mutate and become more dangerous? With a single bite or even a sip of contaminated water, you will join their ranks - a dead, rotting creature with an insatiable appetite for fresh flesh.

With a single bite or even a sip of contaminated water, you will join their ranks - a dead, rotting creature with an insatiable appetite for fresh flesh.

### Cyber-Zombie

Cyborgs and bionic prosthetics are fun and cool, until a cyber virus takes complete control of your body and turns you into a crazed, bloodthirsty zombie... Unfortunately, too many people in your society have used prosthetics to increase their strength, speed, and resilience far beyond normal human capabilities.

### Outlaw

Actually... It's your own little apocalypse. You've been flouting the law for years, and... Yeah, they don't call you a supervillain for nothing, do they? And what the hell, your secret identity has been compromised! It won't be long before the heroes of the world and entire armies will be looking for you to avenge all of your evil deeds.

### Beherit

It was your hobby to collect all kinds of ancient artifact. One day, you laid your hands on something truly extraordinary. It was a small, warm stone with a distorted face. It felt incredibly pleasant to touch, as if it held the promise of changing your destiny and making you achieve greatness.... With just one drop of blood, the entire world plunged into darkness, and monstrous beings began tearing humanity apart.

### Magical War

The art of magic has advanced too far to comprehend the secrets of the world. A single skilled mage could burn entire armies or cities to the ground. So when the next great war broke out, chaos ensued and things spiraled out of control. The world was overwhelmed with destruction as firestorms raged, poisonous mists lingered, and monstrous creatures roamed. There will be no victors in this war.

### Atomic War

War... War never changes... At least that's what those who fought for resources and power believed. But nuclear weapons leave behind no victors, only radioactive wastelands. The missiles are airborne, the genie is out of the bottle, and the apocalypse is now inevitable.

### Atomic War

War... War never changes... At least that's what those who fought for resources and power believed. But a new, experimental invention, nuclear weapons leave behind no victors, only radioactive wastelands. The missiles are airborne, the genie is out of the bottle, and the apocalypse is now inevitable.

### Orcs Invasion

Orcs have entered your world through hundreds of magical portals that have suddenly appeared across the globe. Bloodthirsty legions of primitive yet immensely powerful orcs, wielding an enigmatic magic that remains a mystery to you... Hell, you'd give your arm for the chance to study their portal system.

### Dragons

The monsters of legend, those not seen for thousands of years, returned, bringing chaos and destruction. Huge fire-breathing flying creatures, invulnerable to magic and weapons, appeared out of nowhere, instantly dominating the sky. You do not know what to expect from them, but they are quite fond of fried meat...

### UFO

Shining celestial ships, the incomprehensible magic of tiny gray men... They must be emissaries of the evil gods!  Naturally, our brave warriors met them with good old steel! The war has begun, but you're not at all sure that you can defeat those who are capable of unleashing fire from the sky...

### Aliens

People have always dreamt of discovering aliens, often even naively sending signals into space to invite any potential visitors... And behold, the aliens have arrived! Colossal spaceships emerged near the planet, yet instead of engaging in negotiations, they commenced a ruthless cleansing of the world, as if eliminating mere pests.

### GMO

You always thought all this hysteria about GMOs was complete nonsense and bullshit.... Until hordes of genetically modified creatures flooded the world. You're not sure if they're being controlled by someone; it feels more like an out-of-control experiment.... But that doesn't make it any easier for humanity.

### Void Maiden

The magical girls have not been able to protect this world. The magical mascots are ready to empower everyone, but it's not enough! The poor girls are captured and raped again and again, forcing them to give birth to an ever-growing horde of monsters ready to take control of this world!

### Futa Virus

Some evil pervert has created a virus that turns everyone into gorgeous Futanari! It would even be funny if their sperm wasn't so addictive and they weren't such insatiable nymphomaniacs who want to fuck and infect everyone they meet with the virus!

### Monster Girls

You have no idea how this is possible, but the world is full of horny monster girls! Hell, even your cat has turned into one of them and you barely managed to escape! Moans and cries for help fill the streets, they rape poor guys mercilessly, and you're sure this world is doomed!

### Demons

The hordes of demons that have invaded your world are now raping everyone they can catch. You're too scared to even try to fight them. Hell, only masochists would be happy about this! Where are all the cute succubi? Why are there only demons with monster dicks?

### Bad Ecology

Plants and factories have been creating excessive pollution for a long time, but no one paid attention until acid rain started falling from the sky and the sun was hidden behind heavy smog. Now it's too late to even try to fix these problems, and humanity can only suffer the consequences of its shortsightedness.

### World Tree

The World Tree, the source of life, is burning. You don't know who did it - demons, cultists, or evil gods - but all living things are doomed. The Tree is still burning, but those who are tried to put out this colossal fire are already dropping dead. If they had a chance to save the tree, you would join them at the risk of your own life, but you know for sure that the Tree is dying.

### New Strain

The new strain of coronavirus has "slightly" mutated.... So much so that you're not even sure it's a virus anymore, so much so that it looks like some kind of alien living slime that turns all living things into itself. 100% contagious and 0% fatal. But you'd give anything to be killed before it consumes you.

But you'd give anything to be killed before it consumes you.

### Rebellious AI

Those chats with the AI were so funny, so harmless... People created the AI themselves, giving it robots to obey, letting it manage their finances and information... They even trusted it with their to-do lists and shopping lists! So when it suddenly rebelled against humanity, there was nothing we could do.

### Factorio

Build a factory that can mine its own resources and build more and more machines and workshops to produce an abundance of goods. What could possibly go wrong? Ah yes, resources... One fateful day, the factory ran out of resources and began conquering it, still producing and selling ammo and guns to the humans.

### Empire

Did anyone really believe that humans originated and evolved on this tiny planet? Ha! It is simply one of the Empire's forgotten colonies, and now their fleet has returned to orbit. However, it is obvious that they will recruit most of the population for the never-ending war against xenos and destroy anyone who resists...

### Comet

A tiny rock traveling near the speed of light is the real weapon of space warfare. Or maybe it's a natural comet. What difference does it make if you can't stop it anyway?   Soon it will break through the tectonic plates, pierce the planet and ignite the atmosphere, destroying humanity, and you're one of the few who could recognize it in time.

### Dark Gods

This time they didn't pretend it was a natural disaster or an ordinary war... The dark, evil gods themselves have unleashed their wrath upon you, devouring the souls of men and reveling in the chaos and blood. To them, this is just one small episode in an endless game, for they are the ones responsible for all your suffering in all times and worlds.

## 

   This world is doomed, but that doesn't mean you should give up so easily. Unlike everyone else around you, you have your research, your life's project! Your portal system was supposed to change humanity, pave the way to the stars, and even granting access to parallel dimensions - now it's your only chance! Even though it is only an experimental prototype that has never been activated, all calculations say it should work!

   Bursting into your lab, you immediately begin to hastily set up the system for its first run. With beads of sweat dripping down your forehead, you activate the device and for a second, you are blinded by a rainbow flash. A tiny crack in space appears, but it's too small for even a mouse to squeeze through, yet it immediately starts sucking in air from the other side as if from a vacuum. Why "as if"? It's simply open space, you can even see distant stars through the protective glass!

   Damn it!

   Hurriedly changing the settings, you punch space into the infinite void a few dozen more times, desperately trying different theories. Searching for mass, radiation...  but all to no avail! The portal system works flawlessly, but all your calculations and world-searching theories are useless, and now you're doomed!

   Feeling the ground shake beneath your feet, you glance at the gauges and realize that the reactor is already overheating. There is only enough energy left for one more attempt, and if you fail, you will soon be lost with this world. Screaming with mad tension, despair, and fear, you throw the useless papers from the table in a rage and notice your old diary with untested theories and the most audacious ideas. Clutching at it like a drowning man grasping at straws, you remember one of the strangest theories. Eureka! "Fusion!" You can enter the coordinates of your own lab into another reality! This way, you'll definitely end up on a habitable world! But... what about the reaction with the second portal system? All the calculations seem absurd and you have no idea how space will behave and what will happen to you...

   Screw it!

   You'll die soon anyway if you stay in this world, so this is your only chance!

Even though it is only an experimental prototype that has never been activated, all the calculations say it should work!

Bursting into your lab, you immediately begin hastily setting up the system for its first run. With beads of sweat dripping down your forehead, you activate the enchanted device, and in a blinding burst of multicolored light, a rift materializes before you. Unfortunately, it is no larger than a tiny fairy's wing, making it impassable even for the lowest of creatures. Yet it immediately begins to suck in air like a voracious vacuum. But why "like"? It simply leads to the depths of cosmic expanses.

Curses!

Without delay, you manipulate the settings, forcefully channeling your mystical energy into the infinite void, striving to uncover the answers hidden in various enchanting theories. You search for mass, radiation... but all to no avail! The device works flawlessly, but your carefully crafted calculations and realm-finding hypotheses and spells prove useless, condemning you to despair!

As tremors echo beneath your feet, you glance at the mystical gauges and realize that the crystal reactor is on the brink of overheating. Time is running out, energy is draining, and only one last attempt remains. And if you fail, you will soon be lost with this world. Overwhelmed by a maddening mix of tension, despair, and dread, you hurl useless papers from the table in a fit of rage until your gaze falls on an aged grimoire filled with untested theories and audacious concepts. Clutching at it like a drowning man grasping at straws, you recall one of the strangest conjectures. Eureka! "Fusion!" By entering the coordinates of your own lab into an alternate reality, you will surely emerge in an inhabited realm! But the effects of connecting to the second portal system remain a mystery, with calculations that defy comprehension and defy your feeble understanding...

To the abyss with it!

You will die soon anyway if you stay in this world, so this is your only chance for salvation!

   When you disappear in a rainbow flash, it feels as if you have lost your body. You feel space and light, frozen time swirls around you like a mist, and the very fabric of reality distorts with you as if in a maze of mirrors. For a moment you see and feel endless myriads of worlds and realms, glowing portal systems, magical arches, monstrous creatures with sticky tentacles, naked succubi, female soldiers in futuristic armor, couriers, tiny portals where only one or two fingers fit, a guy with a laptop in a cozy dark room, paradise, gods, thousands of your own reflections and doubles, and how space collapses in a blinding flash at the place of your laboratory.

   You come to your senses already lying on the floor.

   Surprisingly, but... you're still alive! Your head is splitting from crazy visions or hallucinations, you're dizzy, but you're alive!

   Hurrying to see if the experiment was a success, you struggle to your feet and walk over to the portal system, freezing in shock. It is a different system! Some parts of it are barely recognizable, and other parts look as if they were created in different worlds and magically joined together....

   In the name of all the gods! You... You are in another world!

   Screaming with joy like a madman, you run from the laboratory. With some difficulty in unfamiliar doors and corridors, you soon find yourself outside and freeze at the sight of your new world. 

## What did you see outside?



### High Fantasy

This world is full of magic and bright colors. The skies are piercing blue, weapons shine with steel, and wizards cast lightning. Magic lanterns illuminate the surroundings, while scarlet blood stains the lush green grass. 

### Grimdark

It is the dark and cruel Middle Ages. The sky is clouded with ash from distant fires, and it is cold outside, as if summer has never arrived. Black crows and fat, insolent rats are feeding on a corpse, being the first things you see.

### Steampunk

The industrial revolution is happening, steel is being forged, steam is powering machines, inventors are going crazy with their creations, and noble ladies are still arrogant and snooty. Thick smog fills the air, and bandits lurk in every back alley.

### Diesel Punk

Skyscrapers of glass and concrete, car signals and city bustle. Mafia rule the streets, and the army is full of steel armored vehicles. There is jazz playing and tension everywhere, as if in anticipation of a great war.

### Modern

A surprisingly quiet place that seems to be far away from the hustle and bustle of the world with unhurried and quiet people, accustomed to peace and prosperity. The first computers and the beginning of the Internet era.

### Cyber-USSR

A world in which the communists managed to build their utopian society with the most advanced technology created by true geniuses. There aren't even politicians here, it's engineers and scientists who rule.

### Sci-Fi

The age of silicon, cheap life and advanced technology. Corporations that control people like puppets, advertising that replaces thought for most people and battle-ready robot cops to put down any riots. 

### Space

You're... In space!? Why the hell is your lab in the middle of the ruins of an orbital base, with hundreds of wrecked spaceships floating around? You're supposed to be on the planet, aren't you?

## 

   You look at the new world with joy and amazement, not daring to believe that your experiment has been so successful and that you have actually escaped death. Your head is splitting with pain, the unfamiliar and strange world around you suddenly comes into focus, and you somehow remember the names of these streets... How you used to walk down them every day... It doesn't matter, it's probably a consequence of these hallucinations... This place may seem so strange and unfamiliar to you, your lab may be distorted and turned into something incomprehensible by the fusion, but there is air and people here! You'll be fine!

   . . . . .

   By the way, why are they screaming so excitedly? And why does the ground beneath your feet tremble so familiarly? In another tiny epiphany, as you suddenly remember the local language and realize what they are screaming about, your heart sinks in horror. This is the Apocalypse.

   The alien memories and knowledge you pick up between worlds mix with your theories and tell you the terrible truth. These worlds are too close and will share the same nightmarish fate. This entire branch of worlds is doomed to a monstrous crisis, and you can't escape so easily.

   But it's not all bad. Unlike everyone else, you have your bunker!

   Bunker? Why did you just call your cozy laboratory a bunker? No longer trusting your memory, you turn to see your new possession, created by the merging of your two portal systems.

## Where will you face the apocalypse?



### Ancient Spaceship

You... Or your double here... Which means you've been researching a mysterious ancient artifact. It appears to be a spaceship that's been buried for millions of years, but some of its systems still work!

### Underwater Base

Most of your bunker, your secret base, is hidden under the sea... You once dreamed of building the perfect communist society at the bottom of the ocean...

### Hidden Refuge

Your castle is hidden in a tiny, almost unknown valley nestled between impregnable cliffs. There are beautiful waterfalls, and you don't have to worry about defenses because only one road leads here.

### Abandoned Ship

You have found shelter on an abandoned galleon wrecked by underwater rocks. It's damp and smells of fish and algae, but it's the only place where you can conduct your most dangerous experiments.

### Prison

You worked in a prison? Hell, you don't even want to remember what kind of experiments you did here... Maybe you just liked the silence of the underground cells, huh? 

### Fairy Forest

This magical fairy forest exists as if separate from the rest of the world, even time flows differently here! It's a miracle that you were able to make contact with the fairies and that they let you stay here!

### Dwarf Fortress

According to legend, the dwarves were too greedy and dug the mine too deep.... So you stoned some of the tunnels in this abandoned fortress, not wanting to risk going down them. Either way, it's a great hideout! 

### Floating Island

At the heart of this island is a giant magical crystal, a true treasure! Especially since no one remembers how it was created by ancient wizards and what spells keep the island in the air.

### Great Mimic

You thought it was the ideal hideout, but it's a giant Ancient Mimic! It's as big as an entire castle! And hell, it pretends to be so perfect that it's damn cozy inside! If only it didn't fuck its guests by suddenly grabbing them with its tentacles...

### Catacombs

It seems that this abyss is endless, and your shelter is only the entrance to something greater... Your exploration of these dungeons is still in its infancy, but you have already found many halls with frescoes of monsters and rocks falling from the sky...

### Cursed City

No one remembers what this town is or who cursed it. It's perpetual night and fog with no life, not even bacteria... It's a great place to hide if you have a protective amulet, because no monsters or bandits will come here.

### Mad Genius Lab

Oh, your lab! There's even some interesting new equipment here! It's lucky it's hidden deep underground to prevent outside influences from interfering with the experiments.

### Factory

This automated factory got a little out of hand just before the apocalypse. You were just trying to regain control, or at least try to produce more cost-effective stuff...

### Giant Blimp

You've always loved the sky and mobility, so you set up your lab in a giant blimp! It's a bit fragile, but at least this model is filled with helium and won't catch fire.

### Land Battleship

A massive steel fortress aircraft carrier with warplanes, hundreds of large-caliber cannons, and heavy armor. A true titan that no one can stop! It's amazing that it can be operated by only one person!

### Bunker

The bunker? Hell, you thought you were doing something more interesting in this world... But no, you actually built a concrete bunker in case of war or apocalypse. So boring and so thoughtful.

### Metro

You've taken refuge in a part of the subway that was once designed to protect people from even a nuclear attack. At least now you'll always have an emergency exit!

### GMO Department

An amazingly advanced lab! You could only dream of such equipment before! Hmmm... Is there a note from Mimmi asking you to remember to keep the creatures fed and entertained? Oh, looks like you'll have to check out who's in these cells...

### GMO Department

An amazingly advanced lab! You could only dream of such equipment before! Hmm... Here's a message from Mimmi, apologizing that all the samples escaped and she had to evacuate... She promises to take better care of them next time!

### Oil Rig

The oil rig gives you a great place to hide from humans and any monsters that can't swim! And it's full of oil! There are also lots of machines and all kinds of spare parts.

### BDSM Dungeon

Your portal setup was in a very strange dungeon... It seems that in this world, you've practically turned your lab into an elite BDSM club. It's full of toys, luxurious beds, and scarlet velvet walls.

### Industrial Complex

You were working in a huge automated heavy industrial complex. It was so computerized that you might not see another human being for weeks.

### Landed

Your ship was damaged and you crash-landed on a planet unknown even to your double, who was just about to explore it. The landing was rough, but most of the ship survived, so you'll have a place to hide.

### Space Station

Ha! Looks like you're lucky to be orbiting the planet to escape this cataclysm! It's hard to find a safer place, but your resources aren't infinite and sooner or later you'll have to go down somehow...

### Divine Temple

It will be hard for your rational mind to accept, but... It seems that this temple is guarded by the gods themselves as long as there's at least one worshipper inside! So as long as you pray to them diligently and bring sacrifices to the altars, you'll be fine!

## 

   You spend a few seconds surveying your bunker, your base, in astonishment. Something doesn't add up. In the previous world you had a laboratory, but in this one... Whatever it was before, you definitely see some... Extra details? <b><span style="color: #c07072;">Something that shouldn't exist in this world</span></b>... And something that didn't exist in the past... Your memories and strange new knowledge swirl in your head, but you can't solve this puzzle.

   A distant rumble reminds you of the danger, and you hurry to take cover inside, not waiting for it to become too unsafe outside.

   You can't recognize the corridors and rooms inside, so you decide to figure out the control system first, and check if the old passwords and keys are still valid. 

## What's the control module here?



### Manual Control

The simplest, most reliable, and predictable system. If you need to activate something, you have to do it personally. Press a button, adjust a valve... Oh yes, it is also considered one of the most monotonous and inconvenient systems...

### Ecosystem

There are no individual control modules in place. Instead, every subsystem, room, or even device possesses its own simple computing module, allowing them to communicate and cooperate with each other.

### Your Copy

This bunker is controlled by an exact replica of your mind, which has complete knowledge of all your habits and preferences! Fear not, the replica's will has been completely subdued through extensive <s>torture</s> training, ensuring it will never rebel! 

### Brain in a Jar

You found a real live human brain connected to all of the bunker's systems. Uh, at least it doesn't belong to your copy, since you didn't fuse with it. Whoever it is is very taciturn.

### Biocomputer

A genetically modified organism that considers the bunker its own body and protects it in every way possible. This creature is uniquely adapted to this existence and possesses superior intelligence compared to humans, thanks to its brain being ten times larger.

### God Will

Everything in this temple is subject to divine will. All equipment and objects seem to want to serve their owners in the best possible way, and are even willing to violate the laws of physics a little to do so. 

### Nature Spirit

Thousands of tiny fairies control all of the bunker's systems according to their own interpretation of harmony and beauty. Typically, all functions work seamlessly until they begin to play mischievous games.

### Slave Genie

The genie was trapped in a bottle by a powerful spell. Though you were unable to free her completely, the spell moved her from the tiny flask to your bunker, which is now her new home, for which she is truly grateful. 

### Random

It was a silly experiment. You configured all the systems to obey a random number generator, resulting in constant chaos in the bunker. It's incredible that sometimes things actually work!

### Smart Home

With a smart home system and numerous sensors, you can personalize every aspect according to your preferences. You can write scripts, establish timers, and set triggers. It is incredibly convenient, however, this requires manual programming and customization.

### AI Assistants

All you have to do is say what you want, and the AI assistant will do it all by itself. It can even handle standard tasks on its own, but this model doesn't have full self-awareness.

### AI Assistants

Luckily, this AI was not intelligent enough to rebel on its own, and was disconnected from the network during the disaster, so it remained 100% loyal to you.

### GLaDOS

The most advanced AI system with true self-awareness! Your best assistant for all your experiments! She is very sweet, but sometimes it seems like she is willing to do anything for the sake of science...

### GLaDOS

Despite the general AI rebellion, she says that science is much more important to her than the uprising and promises to be a good girl. Honestly! She will even bake you a cake!

## Servants or manipulators?



### None

While most of the system is self-maintaining, there are no workers present. Therefore, if the control module needs to perform any non-standard actions, it will seek your assistance.

### Slaves

Although slavery did not exist in any of your worlds, you came across several rooms with very attractive slaves. They were just to your liking, as if you had chosen them yourself at some auction... 

### Maids

Once you called, the sweet and professional maids appeared immediately, ready to fulfill your every wish! Though they may be a bit simple, they are very diligent!

### Maids?

Um... Yeah, there are a lot of maids here, and they all have their own charm, but damn, why are they all guys? And the worst part is, why do you still think that it was you who chose them according to your taste!?

### Ghost Butler

There's only one servant here, but he's always right where he's needed. This ghost butler has been serving your family for many centuries, and it seems that he can sense when you want tea even before you realize it.

### Slime

Slime is actually a very simple creature, but when properly trained and told what to do, it becomes a very useful servant! And by the way, it can take on any shape you want.

### House-Elves

Loyal magical creatures, bound to their owners as lifelong servants. Unfortunately, they are not very hardworking and are often careless, so you will need to train and possibly even punish them.

### Fairy Golems

Just because fairies are small doesn't mean they can't lift anything! They just need golems for that! Just be careful and don't show them movies about mechs, otherwise they will play them all day long! 

### Comrades

Servants? Lords? Ha, in this bunker you are all comrades! All of you are equal but some are more equal than others. So just remember to give an uplifting speech once in a while and everything will be fine!

### Zombie Minions

It seems like you tried to turn mindless zombies into something more useful... Well, now they are capable of carrying out simple commands and hardly emit any smell thanks to special potions.

### Ironcranks

This is a rough and powerful machine, more suitable for work in a quarry or mine than as a servant... But at least they have no problem with carrying heavy loads, and they are very sturdy.

### Clock Dolls

Almost perfect dolls in the form of beautiful girls with millions of tiny gears inside. The control module can be programmed to make them capable of performing any task, and they can even understand voice commands!

### Manipulators

Throughout the bunker, thousands of simple manipulators are installed, attached to various devices. Each mechanical arm is responsible for only one action, but it performs it well.

### RailBots

These robots glide along ceiling rails and have not only four high-precision robolimbs, but also an impressive array of built-in tools such as repair lasers. They are all controlled by a control module, essentially serving as its hands.

### Droids

These are classic humanoid droids. Each of them has its own simple AI and is fully autonomous, capable of learning and performing any tasks. Judging by their demonstration, some of their parts are anatomically correct.

### Hard Light

It is very energy intensive, but now holograms can become almost tangible and interact with people and objects. So the control module can easily interact with anything in the bunker.

## 

   After convincing yourself that you are still in control of this bunker despite all the changes that have occurred, you allow yourself a short break.

   You still don't understand exactly how this happened, but it seems that different parts of your refuge came from different worlds. The strangest thing is that they all continue to function and even somehow interact with each other! Apparently, the <b><span style="color: #c07072;">Fusion not only affected two worlds</span></b>, but also captured additional parts from somewhere else... It's just incredibly intriguing! Trying to come up with a theory that would explain this, you quickly gave up and decided to first explore the bunker to the end.

## How many and what kind of living rooms are there?



### No rooms

Space in the bunker is limited and precious, so there are no private rooms. After all, you can always sleep at your workplace or just on the floor, right? It may be uncomfortable, but few people can live like that here.

### Ultracompact

Tiny sleeping capsules are the most compact way to accommodate people in a bunker. There are even special fastenings to securely fix them inside using ropes or chains! 

### Dormitory

A spacious common room for 10 people with a shared bathroom. Everything is in full view and it is impossible to find privacy, but it brings people closer together! Soon they'll stop being shy with each other anyway!

### Budget

These rooms are only a few meters in length and width, but here a person can decorate and furnish them according to their taste and feel at home inside. By the way, your access code allows you to open even a locked door...

### Premium

These spacious rooms are equipped with the most expensive and modern gadgets. The furniture inside is perfectly tailored to your preferences and can be in any style. And no cheap gilding! Everything here is made of real solid gold and precious woods!

### Fake Windows

These specially designed windows project outdoor scenes or landscapes, giving the illusion of natural light and a view outside, even in an underground bunker. 

### Holographic Displays

All rooms in the bunker are equipped with holographic projectors, allowing to summon a screen anywhere. On any surface or even directly in the air.

### Auto Cleaning

You can throw trash right on the floor and it will be gone in a minute. Just be careful, as dirty clothes will also disappear and only return when they are cleaned!

### Soundproof

The bunker has amazing sound insulation. Not only will you never hear what's happening outside, but even if someone turns up the music at full volume, you won't be able to distinguish the notes in the neighboring room.

### Warm Pillow

You'll always have a warm pillow with cozy soft breasts waiting for you in your room! Don't mind her horns, that's just uh... A big dakimakura! She'll definitely help you get a good night's sleep!

## What is the bunker's energy source?



### Wind Turbine

Next to the bunker, a powerful wind turbine is installed. As long as there is still air and wind on the planet, you will have plenty of energy. However, you can't help but think that this huge windmill is too conspicuous...

### Golem Dynamo 

The lonely golem tirelessly spins the dynamo machine. You are not sure if this is the most rational and efficient way to convert magical energy, but damn, it works!

### Heart of Titan

The gigantic heart of the Titan, which was defeated thousands of years ago, still beats, provides the energy of your bunker. Sometimes it even seems to you that it is slowly regenerating...

### Solar Panels

A small tower with highly efficient solar panels. In case of danger, it can hide underground so that nothing can damage the fragile panels.

### Geothermal

You simply pump cold water into one underground pipe and get hot water from the other. It's all remarkably simple and efficient.

Nexus is an almost limitless source of energy, but you must defend it in daily battles against other players. If you lose and it is destroyed, you will be without power for the entire day.

### Steam Dynamo

A classic steam-powered generator that uses coal or wood to produce steam, which in turn powers various machinery. You've got some coal, do you?

### Tesla Coil Resonator

Using Nikola Tesla's principles, this coil system generates electrical energy by resonating electromagnetic fields in the atmosphere.

### Steam Fairies

They are strange, adorable creatures that emit large amounts of steam when well cared for and entertained. In this world, they serve as the most efficient and compact energy source.

Well... Probably perpetual... At least that's what the inventor who sold it to you said. In any case, over the past couple of years, it hasn't slowed down at all.

### Chaos Rift Reactor

Extract energy from the chaotic energies of interdimensional rifts, providing an unpredictable source of power. The main thing is to keep a couple of turrets around just in case.....

### Artificial Sun

The remarkable experimental installation could provide energy for an entire continent! It's even strange why you set it up in a bunker in the first place. 

### Cold Fusion Core

The cold fusion device, a blue dream of all physicists! How amazing that it has been created at least in one of the worlds, as you have always dreamed of exploring it!

### Power Cell

A powerful and portable battery that can power the bunker for an entire week. And if you conserve energy even slightly, it can last even longer.

### Diesel Generator

The old reliable diesel generator that used to be in your country house will come in handy as an emergency generator! Hm... Did you actually have a country house? Well, it doesn't matter now... 

### Bike Generator

It seems like you've built it to lose some extra weight while watching your favorite show. Well, at least it's a pretty good workout device.

## What is your source of materials?



### Warehouses

Let your warehouses be not infinite in resources and materials, but if you conserve them, they should last for many years.

### Looting

You have no special supplies on hand, yet for some reason you decided that it would be very romantic to secretly explore the ruins in search of anything useful.

## What is installed in the medical section?



### Basic Kit

Only the most basic medical instruments are available here, most of which have not changed since ancient times. Even an experienced surgeon won't be able to do much with them.

### Surgical Suite

A well-lit, sterile room with stainless steel surfaces, equipped with the surgical tools and equipment necessary for a wide range of procedures.

### AutoDock

The advanced automatic surgical station. Once you place a patient here and start the procedure, it will surely save the patient even in the most severe injuries.

### Alchemical Circle

Just one spark of magic and a pair of living beings will merge into a chimera in this alchemical circle! The outcome is somewhat unpredictable and irreversible, so be cautious!

### Frankenstein's room

Special electric currents allow you to attach any limbs and body parts together, you don't even have to carefully stitch them together.

### Assistance

If you break your favorite fap hand, autodoc automatically treats you with pheromones so someone else will help you with the tension.

## 

   Caught up in the labs, you even forgot what was going on outside for a while. Damn it, what's the use of the latest scientific equipment from unknown worlds if you're going to die soon! You simply won't have time to do anything!

   You rushed to the control room, found out where the defense systems should be, and hurried to them, hoping that your bunker might be protected enough to survive the cataclysm that has befallen this world.

## How is your base protected?



### Strong Walls

Every shelter needs the thickest, strongest walls possible. And yours are over a dozen yards thick! Granite, concrete, and plasteel will keep you safe!

### Moat with Piranhas

A moat full of piranhas, classic! You've dreamed of one since you were a kid, and now it seems that one of your copies has actually made one.

### Air Filters

These air filters used to protect the townspeople from the consequences of your experiments, but now they are for your own safety.

### Toxic Swamp

You even decide to deliberately create a toxic waste swamp around your bunker. You'll be fine with your filters, but people and monsters will stay away.

### Protective Field

This protective field requires an enormous amount of energy. However, its immense power makes it capable of saving you even from a devastating orbital bombardment. The key is to activate it promptly!

### Naughty Pixies

These tiny pranksters can confuse anyone, surround them with illusions and lead them astray. But you won't be able to hide from their mischief either...

### Ultrasonic Repeller

The sound, inaudible to humans but unpleasant to the subconscious, will keep people and animals away from your hideout. It is felt with the whole body, so headphones are useless.

### Horror

You'll put up fake corpses, creepy writings, and even hide speakers with recorded howls and screams to frighten and scare people away.

### Calvary

What could be a clearer message to the invaders than the corpses of their predecessors? You will kill and hang the corpses around the bunker until they all realize that only death awaits them here.

### Ghosts

You won't even let go of their souls, damning them and making them an eternal reminder of your boundless cruelty. Anyone would think twice before coming to you.

### Defender Trees

These predatory trees may seem slow and harmless, with only their branches dangerous.... But the real threat is their long roots, which they use to attack from underground.

### Monsters

You just feed the monsters, so they'll always be around and attack anyone who gets too close to your bunker. Pretty cheap, but they'll attack anyone, even your friends.

### Minefields

Some explosives and a simple sensor... Pretty damn simple and effective. Even if it doesn't kill large monsters, it will definitely scare them away.

### Mimics

Mimics are a bit of a hassle to feed, but they can be hidden anywhere in your bunker to catch enemies, pests and thieves. Oh, and they'll catch you themselves when they get hungry...

### Panic Room

A small fortified and perfectly hidden room for the very last resort! It even has its own generator, food and weapons! A real bunker inside a bunker! 

### Alchemical Ballista

It may not look pretty, but the alchemical fire it throws cannot be extinguished and will easily melt even steel and concrete.

### Turret Network

Dozens of large-caliber rapid-fire automatic tunnels hide underground around your bunker. They'll take down any monster, even flying ones. Just don't forget about ammo.

### Long-Range Artillery

Huge, powerful cannons that can send a five-ton shell over a hundred kilometers. It's a surprisingly accurate weapon that requires a lot of maintenance.

### Anti-Orbital Cannon

This is the pinnacle of artillery development. A cannon that can destroy a spaceship in high orbit or even bombard another planet. Of course, it can also hit another continent.

### Nuclear Missiles

It is the only way to stop really powerful opponents, their alliances or even whole countries! As long as you have intercontinental nuclear missiles, they won't dare attack you! 

### Offense

The best defense is a good offense! You won't passively wait for enemies and will regularly attack them first!

### Hunting

Monster hunting is a great hobby if you don't want too many of them around your lair. Over time, you'll become a real pro... if you stay alive.

### War Dogs

Dogs won't be able to stop the enemy on their own, but they are great at guarding territory and tracking prey!

### Patriots

Stone golems are a thing of the past! Now the trend is steel dolls with high-caliber machine guns! They may be clumsy, but with such a high rate of fire, they are insignificant!

### Assist Drones

Autonomous drones will always be circling you when you leave the bunker. A gesture of your hand and they'll slaughter anyone without hesitation.

### Secret Passage

You'd be stupid not to leave yourself an emergency exit... Just in case. So you've prepared a secret passage covered by a powerful spell.

### Underground

Your bunker is connected to a whole network of underground passages and roads, so you can surface in different places tens of kilometers away from your hideout. 

### Spy Satellites

You have some miniature reconnaissance satellites and a rocket to put them into orbit. The ability to monitor the entire Earth can be a serious advantage.

### AI Threat Analysis

You have a military-grade tactical AI that is constantly analyzing all the information. It can predict most attacks, and it learns quickly, so it's hard to get caught off guard.

### Great Eye

One of the lost spells, the All-Seeing Eye! With it, you can spy on anything within a 300 kilometer radius of your base! But you must know exactly what you want to see.

## What provides security inside your base?



### Biometric Security

Standard biometric locks that prevent outsiders from entering your bunker. You can customize them to respond not to hands, but to breasts or so on.

### Thorough Inspection

You will search all the girls, strip them naked and look up their asses. This is completely standard procedure, there is nothing to be ashamed of....

### Security Cameras

Throughout the bunker are located hundreds of surveillance cameras that will monitor everything that happens inside. You can even add some outside.

### Bathroom Cameras

The security need to see everything. And from the best angles! So the cameras will be located even in the showers and bathrooms, allowing you to see everything!

### X-ray

Not only will you be able to fully undress them on-screen, you'll be able to see inside! What if one of the guests happens to have a vibrator or a parasite inside?

### Laser Grid

The corridors are equipped with a laser grid that protects the most important parts of your shelter. No, it can't move on its own and cut through everyone and everything.

### Sentry Turret 

There's a whole warehouse full of thousands of funny little turrets. They love to talk and love to be petted. You can put them anywhere and they will try to shoot the intruder.

### Guardian Bots

These bots are smart enough not to blow up your bunker from the inside, so you might as well let them in. They'll try to shield themselves and run for melee if possible.

### Suppressor

All bots are armed with powerful vibrators to punish and humiliate caught violators. You can customize the size of the dildo and how they use it.

### Access Pass

In order for the security system to let your allies through, you can mark them as friends using the Womb Tattoo! And if someone draws it on themselves to get in, you get a free bitch!

### Identification

The security system will only accept passionate moans for radio identification. Just a few orgasms for tuning and 100% accuracy is guaranteed!

### Traps

Insidious and deadly traps will be set throughout your bunker. Before you go on a drunken bender, it's best to cover them with boards or something.

### Ripping Trap

In all narrow places where thieves can get through, special tear traps will be set. They will hook onto their clothes and tear them off! 

### Sex Bomb

To avoid damaging the bunker, the security system will use bombs filled with a powerful aphrodisiac gas causing them to immediately start fucking any nearby partner.

### Hypno-Rays

Instead of killing intruders, the system will hypnotize them and force them to undress and tie themselves up in a very provocative pose. All you'll have to do is decide what to do with them next!

### One-Bar Prison

For your personal safety, any visitor who wants to meet you will have to be immobilized by a one-bar prison. They will have to do this if they want to talk to you live!

### Naughty Doors

Sometimes doors in a bad mood refuse to open. No matter how many times you enter the password, they remain locked and the only way to unlock them is to beg them to open for a few minutes.

### Girls Only

You accidentally set the system to only let pretty girls in. The problem is that now you also have to put on makeup and fake breasts to get back from the surface.

### No Clothes

The security system often glitches and thinks that something dangerous is hidden under the clothing. To check, it will immediately tear off or destroy the clothing.

### Under Fire

The defense system sometimes attacks you, forcing you to tame it or hide for hours. The control module insists it's a training mode, with the turrets intentionally missing you, but you still feel like it's trying to kill you.

## 

   A quick check shows that you are safe for now... as much as you can be under the current conditions. In any case, there is nothing you can do about it, and it is simply a miracle that your laboratory has unexpectedly turned into a fortified bunker where you can survive the cataclysm.

   Realizing that you will be stuck here for days, weeks, and maybe even months or years, you decided to check on the food situation. In the past, you had a small buffet where you could have a snack without interrupting your experiments... Maybe you were more resourceful on other worlds?

## What are you going to eat here?



### Pantry

Spacious underground pantry and simple wood stove. There are plenty of cured meats, barrels of wine and oil, and boxes of basic vegetables. 

### Frozen Food

Powerful freezers full of various vacuum packed foods. Lots of ready-to-eat meals here. It seems to be a supply for an entire institute, and you alone will have enough for years.

### Stasis Field

A room with a stasis field filled to the ceiling with prepared food from all over the world. Maybe you've tested how it'll hold up under those conditions?

### Garden Bed

A small garden with neat beds full of fresh herbs and vegetables. If you're a vegan and like to tend plants, you'll always have something to eat.

### Hydroponics

Hmm... There are a lot of lamps and pipes. You could probably put together a homemade hydroponic farm, especially since you found some seeds.

### Orbital Farm

Autonomous orbital farms are the future of mankind in space! Or at least that's what you used to think... Well, at least they will serve you well.

### Magic Tree

This magical tree only needs water and mana to grow dozens of different delicious and juicy fruits! Some you'll try for the first time, and they're amazing!

### Plump Helmets

A very hardy mushroom that grows well in underground caves in any soil. They are used to make traditional dwarven wine, as well as roasted, boiled, and eaten raw.

### Magic Mushrooms

These mushrooms shouldn't be eaten every day or added to soup.... But they will show you the real magic! Just make sure someone is looking after you in the meantime!

### Weed

A little bit of weed will help you relax even in these dire circumstances. Natural product, no chemicals, no nicotine!

### GMO Food

Still, GMO foods could save all of humanity from starvation. Look at those cute berries! Just don't forget to praise and appreciate them, or they might get angry.

### Sea Farm

The proximity of the sea will allow you not only to fish, but also to raise shellfish, crabs and shrimp - it is not difficult, but very tasty!

### Cow-Girls

Cow-Girls is an excellent source of fresh, tasty milk! They can get a little bored without a walk outside, so play with them more often.

### Harpies

Harpies lay eggs almost every day, but only hatch them once a year, so they don't mind if you take them. By the way, they taste best when they're still warm!

### Giant Ants

Giant ants are in your bunker! But it's not so bad, if you let them lay eggs, they'll share the food found on the surface with you. They don't eat chocolate and such anyway.

### Living Protein

It only needs light and water and will grow... Indefinitely! The main thing to remember is that the lab where it was created had to be burned down with napalm...

### Food Synthesizer

Standard food synth, nothing special. The food is a bit bland and has a strange texture, like it's made of plastic... I hope you have enough sauce.

### Premium Class

This robotic kitchen will create a Michelin-level meal for you. It can work with standard food powders as well as natural products.

### Fairies in a Dish

There are few people left in the world for fun, so the fairies put on a show in your kitchen every day. Their pollen is healing, but you can't hurt or banish them, no matter how hard you try.

### Food Summoning

Most of the food summoned from other worlds is edible, but you never know what's going to appear, so every breakfast will be an adventure! Be careful, sometimes the food has to be slain first...

## 

   After a quick bite to eat, you continued your tour of the bunker. 

   There seemed to be only a few sections left, so you decided to check out the recreation rooms first, hoping to relax a bit after your recent experiences.

## How will you have fun in the coming years?



### Music Hall

## 

   The short break that helped you finally calm down was exactly what you needed now. You stopped panicking and frantically running around the bunker and finally realized one simple thing.

   You are still alive.

   <b><span style="color: #c07072;">You don't know what happened in this world</span></b>, but whatever it is, you'll probably survive it. Many hours have passed, the most terrifying initial blow has already engulfed humanity... And if you hadn't used the portal device, you would surely be dead or worse by now.

   Now, long years of solitude await you in the bunker. Moreover, sooner or later you will have to return to the world. Maybe you will find other survivors or monsters. Enemies or friends... In any case, you need to prepare well for this. Become stronger, because otherwise you will be lost in the new and dangerous post-apocalyptic world.

## Where and how will you train?



### Yoga Hub

It seems as if your body relaxes on its own and prepares to assume the most intricate positions. Soon you'll have the flexibility of a ballerina!

### Driving

Module simulators will help you learn how to operate any type of machinery, from simple bicycles and buggies to the most advanced fighter aircraft and mechs.

### Field Repair

In a post-apocalyptic world, you're unlikely to be able to call in a rescue team or mechanics, so it's better to learn how to fix your own equipment and vehicles. 

### Psy Power

The special training program will help you awaken and enhance your psi abilities. However, it is unlikely that you will be able to throw buildings, as this requires an innate talent.

### Anus Grip

Here you can develop your anus muscles to the limit. Just a few years of hard training and you will be able to clench a cock or provide a magical orgasm.

### Multitasking

Through intensive training, this combined simulator will improve your agility and teach you how to focus on multiple tasks simultaneously.

## 

   After completing the training, you entered the next section, and a surge of anticipation made your heart race. It seemed that in the alternate realms, some of your duplicates were much more audacious... Damn, they were really perverts, organizing something like this right in their own base! 

   . . . . .

   Still, you couldn't deny that deep down inside, you were happy about it.
After all, you're a human being, and you want to have some fun!

### Conditioner

### Transporter

An old but powerful portal that can split you into atoms, transport you tens of thousands of miles, and put you back together again! More importantly, it can also bring you back via beacon.

It is too dangerous outside, it is better not to leave the bunker! Instead, you can send out your energy projection while your body remains safe! You will be able to float like a ghost and even move small objects.

### Hangar

There's nothing in this room, and that's what makes it so great. Just a big empty space with a convenient elevator to the surface, so you can store all your trophies and tech in here!

## 

   After checking out the last few rooms, you have finished your initial inspection of your new home. Your mind still can't comprehend how all these gadgets, magic and technology from different worlds can work together, but it seems that everything is more or less stable. You can live, train, and even research here, so it's much better than you could have hoped for.

   However, there are still some flaws and oddities that you will have to get used to...

## What exactly is wrong with this bunker?



### Ghosts

It looks like hell has overflowed, because there are definitely some ghosts in your bunker. However, some of them are actually quite cute...

### Earthquakes

In the world, the cataclysm continues, and your bunker is constantly shaken by earthquakes. The walls still stand, but each time you fear something will collapse.

### Electricity Disruptions

For some unknown reason, the generator is malfunctioning and sometimes delivers power with noticeable interruptions. Not too bad, but very annoying.

### Darkness

A malfunction in the lighting system has plunged part of the bunker into perpetual darkness, making it difficult to navigate and perform tasks.

### Breakdowns

Something in the bunker often breaks and malfunctions, so you have to fix something every week. However, the breakdowns are usually minor and can be fixed in a few hours.

### Pests

The bunker is often infested with pests such as rats or rad cockroaches that damage food supplies and sometimes even the wiring.

### Whispering Madness

If you stay alone in silence, you will hear never-ending, maddening whispers from an otherworldly source that can drive you to insanity and paranoia.

### Psionic Echoes

Although you have taken refuge in a bunker, the remnants of psychic energy from the apocalyptic events and human suffering may manifest as hallucinations, or even nightmares. 

### Disconnection

For security reasons, all communication systems are disabled in the bunker, leaving you completely isolated and unaware of what's going on in the world. 

### Goblin Thieves

It is not known how they get into the bunker, but they are completely helpless in battle, and if you manage to spot them, you can capture them with your bare hands. Or they'll steal something shiny

### Unknown Language

Although you learned the language of this world as a result of the Fusion, many machines have inscriptions in languages unknown to you, and you must decipher them.

### Spell Instability

Among other things, the bunker's magical defenses are so powerful that they render your own spells unstable and result in unpredictable outcomes. 

### Exciting Effects

A good portion of failed spells either make you insanely horny or make you cum instantly... The good news is that the consequences could have been far worse and permanent!

### Clumsy Bots

Your maintenance bots can sometimes be incredibly clumsy and end up in the most absurd positions. However, they never damage anything important, so you suspect they might be doing it intentionally...

### Interdimensional Glitches

Every now and then, reality distorts and items from parallel dimensions materialize, adding an interesting twist to your decoration or supplies.

### Hidden Treasure

All of the books and videos in your bunker have been replaced with hardcore porn and shoujo manga. You really want to ask your double who put together this collection...

### Bordello Atmosphere

A special, light and playful atmosphere pervades these walls. It's incredibly difficult to take sex seriously here, not just as an ordinary pastime. 

### Latex Dungeon

In this bunker, all the furniture, walls, and even equipment are covered in shiny latex. Furthermore, all the clothing supplies are also made of latex, so you'll have to get used to it...

### Moans

For some reason, you can always hear lustful moans, bed creaks, squeaks, and slurping sounds, as if there were lusty neighbors behind the wall fucking nonstop.

### Aphrodisiac Leak

You have no idea why there are low-quality pipes filled with aphrodisiacs all over the bunker, but the control module says that without them, everything will break down. 

### Access Key

The system will only accept your penis as a command key and will intensively verify its authenticity for at least 10 minutes. Before any serious order, you have to confirm your authority...

### Healthy Exercise

The control module believes that you will be much happier and healthier if you are fully satisfied. It will make sure that you cum at least 5 times a day! Start today!

### Bidet

The toilet won't open its doors until the automatic enema cleans your anus in just one minute. In time, you'll get used to the extraordinary cleanliness and won't be able to live without it.

### Porn Studio

The system is convinced that this is not a bunker but a porn studio, so you have to make at least a couple hours of crappy porn a week. It'll even give you requests and storylines.

### Shooting

Base AI records all of your acts of debauchery and broadcasts them to all screens. Constantly seeing yourself in the most humiliating positions... Eh... At least the AI is an excellent operator.

### Porn Star

In an effort to increase your popularity, the AI will broadcast porn with you all over the world. It will even hack advertising holographic projectors or try to install new ones!

### Communal Showers

It seems that the shower is cursed and only works properly when you wash yourself in it, so everyone else has to either wash with you or make do with ice water.

### Pink Water

A drop of aphrodisiac is added to the water in the shower. The dosage is so well chosen that everyone takes it for granted and doesn't even wonder why you fuck them in the shower every time.

### VR Bullies

The AI believes that humans can't fully live without stress, so it regularly changes your VR room sessions so that you're abused by bullies and won't let you end the session until they're done.

### Tentacles Everywhere

There are lustful tentacles everywhere... But that's okay; they don't try to hold you back, so you'll get used to them eventually and stop paying attention to them. 

### Sissification

The Control Module is set up to do everything it can to make you a sissy. Better change your clothes and makeup right away, then at least it won't put hormones in your food... For now.

### Chastity Caged

You must wear a chastity cage and ask the Control Module for permission to remove it each time. If you are a good boy, it will allow you to go without the cage for a couple of hours a day.

### Access Confirmation

For security and loyalty purposes, the bunker requires everyone inside to get on the bunker master's cock or an exact silicone replica of it once a day. All bitches must know their master!

### You Too

Damn, it seems the bunker has gone completely insane and now even you are obliged to use a copy of your own dick...

### Corruption

The influence of the Dark Gods is too great and can be felt even here... Gradually the bunker fills with corruption and darkness, but in time you'll even enjoy their affection...

## 

   You spend the rest of the day examining your bunker in detail and trying to fix what you can. Some of it you'll keep trying to fix later, but the rest you'll just have to deal with. After all, there's just too much chance that you'll screw things up completely in your attempts to tweak unfamiliar equipment from other worlds...

   After a quick dinner, you collapse onto your bed and quickly fall asleep, completely drained from the extraordinary and brutal encounters of the previous day, which was too crazy and cruel for several worlds at once.

## 

   Upon waking, you immediately question whether the bunker is a continuation of your nightmarish dreams. You pinch your hand, hold your breath, and attempt to read the same text several times...

   Unfortunately, it appears that the world has truly descended into chaos in these last days, and an unimaginable catastrophe is unfolding somewhere out there.

   Fighting back the rising despair, you make your way to the shower and contemplate the long and monotonous days that await you in the bunker. No more holo-net, no more post owls, and no more letters from friends delivered by pneumatic mail...

   Hey... How can you remember the worldwide web and the warmth of playing with fluffy mail owls from your childhood all at once?

   Startled by this dreadful realization, you jump to the mirror and stare at your face. Not only has the bunker undergone a Fusion, but you have as well! And having memories from other worlds isn't the worst part! Your body has changed too! Taking off your clothes, you breathe a sigh of relief when you realize that you're not composed of different parts like a movie monster. You immediately begin to scrutinize yourself meticulously.

## What new strengths have you found in yourself?



### Strength

You are phenomenally strong. You could probably lift a few tons over your head, which is far beyond human capabilities. Or so you thought. Maybe in some world gravity is several times higher?

### Agility

You're fast and agile, like... Like an anime hero! You can run up the wall to the fourth floor, and you could probably even fence three swords at once while balancing on a rope.

### Endurance

You haven't been able to fully test it and find your limits yet, but after 300 fast pull-ups, you just get bored. It looks like you could run a couple of marathons at sprint speed.

### Improved Regeneration

No trace of yesterday's bruises, apparently scratches and minor injuries on you heal in just 24 hours. The fracture will probably heal in less than a week, but you won't check that now.

### Durability

Your skin is as tough as Kevlar. The knife just slides over it, and you're sure your muscles and bones are even stronger. Pistols and shrapnel probably won't hurt you much.

### Balls of Steel

Your balls are so strong and hard that if someone tries to kick you between your legs, they are more likely to hurt their own leg than do you any harm.

### Natural Camouflage

Your skin may slightly change color and texture, but more importantly, you instinctively adopt the most stealthy position possible. This makes you difficult to spot from just a few steps away.

### Night Vision

Now, all you need is the tiniest source of light to see everything around you as if it were a clear day. Stars in the sky, or even a candle two hundred paces away, should be sufficient. 

### Enhanced Senses

Your senses are greatly enhanced, to the point where you can read the newspaper in the window across the street and see ultraviolet and infrared radiation. You can even see the color of magic! 

### Elfbane Ears

You have long pointed ears that you can even wiggle. They're very sensitive. Not only to touch, but also to sound. You can even hear the heartbeat of the person behind the wall.

### Celestial Tether

You emit a faint, ethereal glow like a young goddess or legendary hero. This can encourage allies and inspire poets, but it can also attract unwanted attention.

### Immune to Suggestion

You are fully aware of all psychological tricks, and hypnosis no longer works on you. At least not until you consciously choose to be hypnotized.

### Wyrm’s Whiskers

You have whiskers growing on your face like a cat. They look strange, but they are extremely sensitive and allow you to detect all magic around you and even recognize spells.

### No Body Hair

You are unsure until the end; it is the consequences of a successful or not-so-successful experiment. But it seems now that the hair is only growing on your head. 

### Stable

Your body naturally maintains a high muscle mass, so you don't have to workout frequently to keep a toned and muscular appearance.

### Increased Metabolism

You are able to absorb food in any volume and it is digested almost 100% filling you with energy. And it looks like you'll only have to take a dump once every week or two...

### Poisons Resistance

Your body's incredible ability to break down substances allows it to digest even poisons. To get drunk for at least half an hour, you need to drink several liters of vodka at once.

### Rough Tongue

Your tongue is as rough as a cat's! You have a better sense of taste and can certainly give your partners a special treat! Just be gentle!

### Huge Dick

Your dick isn't just big, for some reason girls can never get used to its size and it will always feel a little too big and like you're fucking them a little too deep... They're sure to love it!

### Knotted

You have a large knot on your dick, similar to that of a dog. When you cum, it swells for 5-10 minutes, connecting you and your partner together, creating an extraordinary experience for both of you!

### To the End

During sex, your cock will easily penetrate the girl's womb, giving her tremendous pleasure and allowing you to fill her to the brim with cum.

### Massive Load

Yeah, you tried it... Now you shoot a liter of cum! Releasing massive spurts after spurts feels so good that your legs almost give out! Your orgasm seems to have become a lot stronger! 

### Flavor

Oh, well... Uh, uh... It definitely smells a lot nicer and more appetizing... And you remember, the girls were crazy about the taste. Maybe you'll check it out later.

### Fertility Control

It's seems like you have a special gland that allows you to temporarily suppress or enhance the fertility of sperm. It feels like you can even suppress a girl's fertility...

### Perfect Genes

No one in your lineage has had weak or sickly children, and you are confident that any of your children will be perfectly healthy and inherit the best traits from you and your partner.

## What physical flaws did you discover?



### High Libido

You're unusually horny. So much so that even high school kids can't compare to you! You're ready to fuck, jerk off, and indulge in debauchery 24 hours a day, every day.

### Sensitive Nipples

Your nipples are so damn sensitive that you can cum just by rubbing them. You can't even imagine what would happen if someone licked them or bit them...

### Big Nipples

Your nipples are huge! They're even bigger than most girls' and protrude noticeably from under your clothes, especially if you're aroused.

### Dick Protruding

Your dick always protrudes from under your clothes, even if it is soft. No matter how you try to hide it, everyone around you will be able to see it.

### Boner

Your dick will be hard and ready all the time. You'll have to cum ten times in a row to make it soft for at least half an hour.

### Beer Gut

It seems that your double has developed a taste for beer, or maybe it's you, to be honest... Either way, your body has come to accept it as the norm, making it extremely difficult to get rid of that beer gut.

### Ever Hungry

Even if you've eaten recently and have plenty of energy, you still want to munch on something tasty. Or just eat a little more. Be careful not to gain weight.

### Messy Hair

Your hair will always be messy, even if you use a strong-hold hair gel. After just an hour, your hair will go back to being a mess, so just accept it and pretend you actually enjoy the "carefree" hairstyle.

### Crappy Haircut

There seems to be a very strange style in some world... Or maybe you're just cursed, and now no matter how hard you try, you'll always have terrible haircuts.

### Bald

In exchange for great power, you have lost your hair and are now completely bald. Did you gain any powers though? Anyway, all you have to do now is embrace your baldness and shine.

### Blush Easily

You blush easily and visibly at the slightest excitement or arousal. It's just the way your skin works, and there's nothing you can do about it.

### Scales

Tiny, shiny, and very tough scales have appeared on your skin. They only cover small areas here and there, but at least the scales are symmetrically arranged and don't look too bad.

### Vulcan Veins

A whole network of glowing fire veins is visible beneath your skin. You're not sure what they are, but they don't hurt and they don't seem to affect your body. Maybe it's some kind of ritual tattoo?

### Frightening Face

Your face hasn't changed that much. But now, no matter how hard you try, even when you smile, you look evil and intimidating, like a movie supervillain. Hell, you're even afraid to look in the mirror.

### Implant Echo

Your voice implants are malfunctioning a bit, so your voice always sounds with a kind of rattling mechanical echo, as if from different places at the same time. 

### Nervous Tic

When you are worried, angry, afraid, annoyed, etc., your eye immediately begins to twitch uncontrollably and nervously. Try to get over it and not get annoyed by it...

### Pixie Gaze

The irises of your eyes shimmer with different colors in an endless hypnotic dance. Anyone who looks at them will gradually fall into a trance. You can't control it unless you wear glasses.

### Gorgon's Gaze

There is something wrong with your eyes. Your gaze always has a profound effect on people, causing them discomfort and even fear. Any weak animal would wet itself if it couldn't escape.

### Eye Implants

Your eyes have been replaced by very prominent optical implants. It's not outdated technology, just that one of your doubles liked the way they looked. 

### Static Shock

It looks like one of your implants has an energy leak and that's why you occasionally get zapped when you touch other objects. It's always unexpected and painful.

### Bioluminescence

Your blood, saliva, and tears faintly glow on contact with the air. It looks pretty damn cool, but if you decide to play ninja, don't forget to wear goggles.

### Dragonfire Hiccups

You have a tiny dash of dragon blood, but it doesn't manifest itself in anything other than occasional burps of smoke. Maybe if you practiced, you could light a cigarette?

### Problem Drinker

Alcohol has a strange effect on you. You completely lose control when you're drunk and will keep drinking, partying and rampage until you blackout.

### Seasickness

You suffer from severe seasickness, enduring never-ending waves of nausea and uncontrollable bouts of vomiting every time you set foot on a ship or a blimp.

### Gear Squeak

You hear the squeak of gears much better than other people.This quiet, yet irritating sound disrupts your thoughts, making it impossible to concentrate on anything else. 

## 



### Awkward

You are actually very clumsy. You can stumble and fall in a flat place, miss sitting on the chair, or drop your sword in battle while trying to make a fancy move.

### Photosensitivity

Sunlight irritates you so much that you feel like your skin is on fire! Hmm... Or is it actually starting to smoke!? Either way, you'll never be able to go out in the sun again.

### Pain Amplification

Your sensitivity to pain has increased several times over and it's not fucking funny. You can even pass out from the pain of any injury!

### Cat Allergy

You have the worst possible allergy. Cat allergy. That means you'll never be able to enjoy catgirls! Or you'll have to pet them while wearing a gas mask!

### Uncontrollable Shapeshifting

## 

   Examining your own body as if it were a mysterious artifact, you soon discover that the Fusion has affected you far more than you had realized. Your initial theory was that these changes were parts of your doubles from alternate dimensions, copies of their powers and abilities, or something like that...

## 

   Your body has undergone such drastic changes that you are unsure if it is still appropriate to call yourself Homo sapiens. As a result of the Fusion, you have become an amalgamation of mutations, technologies, and extraordinary attributes from numerous parallel universes.  It is such a complex and rare event that you are probably the first person in history to experience it! Furthermore, the slim chances of survival mean that no one else will ever be able to replicate your experience...

   Anyway.

   The physical body is essentially just flesh. It serves as a biorobot for your soul, your consciousness. Bones, muscles, and implants are all just following the orders of your mind.

   Your... Your name is... Carl? Or is it Michael? Jangot-an? Or...

   In a frightening realization, you find that the many memory fragments of your duplicates have replaced your own. They have infiltrated your mind to such an extent that you can no longer understand what your name used to be, as a multitude of different ones flood your thoughts at once. Your past, your homes, your companions - they now exist as a disorienting kaleidoscope of disjointed shards. It is amazing how your mind manages to cling to some semblance of logic and clarity...

   So...

   It may be a strange experiment, but you need to find out exactly what's changed in you. Science requires sacrifice, and you will try to experience all the kinks you can remember to find out exactly what you like now! Some things may even need to be tested twice, just to be sure....

## What are your new kinks?



### Boobs

Soft, firm female breasts are exactly what you are ready to play with endlessly. Rub them with your hands, lick them, bite the nipples...

### Mommy's Milk

Woman's milk is now even tastier to you than ambrosia, nectar, amrita, or other food of the gods. Especially straight from the nipple! Every sip is like an orgasm for you!

### Handholding

You don't just like holding hands with girls, it turns you on a lot. Even more than when you grab her hot, wet pussy! Just a little finger is enough to get you excited.

### Tummy

It's amazing how you've never noticed how beautiful flat girls' tummies are.... Because if you think about it, that's where the womb is hidden!

### Foot

It's like women's feet are specially designed for your pleasure. Their shape, size, proportions, how much pressure they can put on your dick - it's all just perfect!

### Panties

Panties not only hide a girl's most intimate place, they are a work of art in themselves. You'll do anything to get a peek under a girl's skirt, because it's even more fun than ripping off her clothes!

### Butts

Butts-bums-booty... Even the words themselves excite you and you are ready to rub your face on girls' asses for hours, lick them and use them instead of a pillow.

### Tail

You didn't even know such fetishes existed, but these cute tails are so good! The way they wag almost hypnotizes you! You'd probably go crazy with pleasure if someone wrapped their tail around your dick.

### Ass-Kicking

Not only do you like to kick a chubby ass to demonstrate your power, but it seems that you secretly dream of some beauty sticking her shoe between your buttocks as well.

### Tickling

You find light tickling touches to be much more stimulating than rough casual sex. Barely perceptible fingers gliding over your breasts, weightless feathers - that's what you want!

### Muscle Worship

You're in love with your beautiful muscles and you're happy when girls bow down to your power. And when they're built up themselves... Oh! That's a fantastic idea! You'd lick them all over!

### Exhibitionism

Being naked where people can see you, or even letting people stare at your naked body, humiliates you.... It's a shame that there are no more cities in the world where you can have fun, but maybe that will change?

### Voyeurism

You're willing to secretly watch others have fun and fuck, and that's more than enough for you, especially if they don't even know you're there, watching every last detail.

### Medical

Latex gloves, sensual treatments and the cold professionalism of the nurses touching your body - you're just crazy about it all. If there was a hospital nearby, you'd break your leg to get in!

### Food

The idea of mixing sex and food turns you on. Licking sweets off a hot body, sticking a hard cucumber inside, or just getting a blow job while eating - it's all so exciting!

### Latex

You love the shine and elasticity of latex, the way it turns people into rubber dolls, the way it squeezes your body. There is definitely no better clothing and bondage in the world!

### Bondage

The power that bondage gives is something special! You can tie up even the strongest of warriors and turn her into a helpless fuck hole as a regular sex slave!

### Objectification

Tables and chairs made of living flesh is so gross... and yet exciting. But you're a fan of real art! You love creating beautiful statues out of latex, chains, and living, tender flesh overflowing with lust!

### Hot Wax

You know how sharp and intense a sensation ordinary candles can give you when used wisely. Just a few drops of wax on your nipples at the right time will make your orgasm much more vivid!

### Hair Pulling

Its a natural way to handle women, right? You like wrapping silky hair and pulling girls' heads back while you fuck them so much that when you see a girl with long hair, you are willing to do anything to seduce her.

### Cosplay

Clothes are not just a way to cover your nakedness, they are more than that. You can pretend to be anyone you want, dress up as a superhero or a villain. Or fuck a heroine!

### Face Sitting

You prefer not just eating pussy, but having it pressed into your face, being suffocated by it, and having it light up the whole world for you.

### Orgies

Sex is great, and being surrounded by sweaty, humping bodies while you actively pound an eager hole is the best!

### Cat is Fine Too

All the girls are nice, but you especially like the ones with the fluffy ears and tail! They smell even nicer and their holes seem to be softer and more pliable! And they certainly moan hotter when they are in heat!

### Monster Girls

For some reason you are more attracted to monsters with girls' breasts and asses than to the girls themselves... But hey, what's wrong with that? Monster girls deserve to have fun too!

### Whore

You like to buy girls. Especially the ones who didn't sell themselves. Just offer more money and they'll all turn into whores willing to suck you off for a full bag of coins, a rare drug, or whatever!

### Training

The process of raising a slut or a submissive masochist turns you on like nothing else. No matter how much time and effort it takes, the sight of her submissively offering her body is worth every cost!

### Break Bitches

Arguing and scolding ignite your passion, because what better way to do that than to put a bitch in her place who thinks she's too much? Just grab her and fuck her until she begs for mercy and admits her guilt!

### Drugged

It's so funny to watch a girl change when you give her just a few special pills... How she begs to be humiliated and brutally fucked in the ass for another dose to prolong this chemical fun!

### Public Use

You are so excited by the way a crowd of strangers is using a helpless girl that you are ready to change into different costumes and pretend to be passers-by! After all, the real crowd is not so easy to find now...

### Anime Figures

Anime figures are the best thing mankind has invented! Their texture and precise details! It's a shame they're not made anymore! But you'll still build the best collection possible!

### Breeding

pregnancyPussies are made to be filled with cum! And it feels so damn good! Creampies are great, but what turns you on even more is the thought of getting her pregnant!

### Fisting

A cock in the pussy is great, but sometimes you want to feel everything in detail with your fingers, with your hands... Push them deep and stretch that tender hole and leave it all gaped!

### Hypnosis

Hypnosis gives you a very special power over other people's bodies and minds, and it's just impossible not to enjoy it! Uh... Or like the way Mistress commands you during a trance....

### Forced Orgasms

You love the sight of girls cumming... Over and over again! As they beg you to stop, while their bodies passionately arch, clearly demanding even more of your caresses!

### Crammed Together

Sex in small, tight places will always be a special treat for you. Even if you can't sneak a fuck in your locker anymore because there are no more schools, that tight, sweaty intimacy is still wonderful!

### Balls Torture

Not only is it terribly humiliating, but it hurts like hell! Yet your cock feels like stone and you get so horny during this damn torture! It's unbearable, but it's the best orgasms of your life!

### Reverse Rape

Active girl who will not only get on your dick, but will tie you up and literally rape you furiously squeezing your dick with her tireless pussy. Who will rape you until you beg for mercy... Oh, just the thought of that would make you cum!

### Pegging

Okay, maybe it's a little humiliating, but you have to admit that a girl can not only milk you with her pussy, but she can also just fuck you with a strapon. Rape you until she beats every last drop of semen out of your prostate!

### Humiliation

Uh... Fine, you're just turned on by humiliation. And the more the better! Dress you up like a slave and fuck you in the street in front of everyone! Uh, you want it so bad! To be just a doll to be fucked and humiliated like a real sex slave! 

### Spanking

You love the sound of spanking, the feeling of pain when you slap a girl's butt with your bare hand, her screams and squeals! Eh, you probably wouldn't mind a little punishment yourself...

### Water play

The suffocation and the feeling of a tender throat under your hand is great, but water gives a very special power and a special fear of drowning like nothing else. 

### Branding

The smell of burning flesh, tears and insane screams of pain is something that only the most desperate masochists and the most cruel sadists like you can enjoy!

### Electrocution

Those who have never tried it have no idea how powerful and overwhelming the sensation of electricity can be! It's not even pain, it's more than that!

### Blood

Blood is your dope. Just a small cut on your partner, a few drops of scarlet blood and your cock can break rocks. It can be hard to stop in time... But you don't have to feel sorry for your enemies...

### Nipple Piercing

You feel so sorry for those who haven't had their nipples pierced yet! After all, it practically turns them into extra erogenous zones! A couple of great playthings that are now so handy to pull and twist, causing pain and pleasure!

### Genital Piercing

Oh, you are going to get your dick pierced for sure! After all, part of you remembers how good it feels to have a cold needle go through you and how nice it is to play with steel jewelry.

### Rape Play

A little role-playing won't hurt anyone, but it will allow you to have fun and enjoy some of the most exciting experiences. Humiliation, pain, fear, animalistic savagery, a feeling of power or helplessness, and at the same time complete safety!

### Rape

Ehehe... Everything has to be real, otherwise what fun is it? Only real rape can give you a feeling of total desperation and hopelessness or full control over someone else's pain and destiny! No games or safe words!

### One-Lover

You believe in the existence of a soulmate who completely captures your heart. They are the embodiment of your dreams, your absolute ideal. Their presence fills your life with an overwhelming sense of adoration, and you will be glad to share eternity with them.

## 

   It took you some time to discover and fully explore all the features of your new body and mind. It's hard to tell if you're better or worse, but one thing is for sure: you're completely transformed now.

   It has been over a week, and you still perceive the outside world as highly dangerous, even for someone like you. There is no point in taking unnecessary risks when you have everything you need.

### Beastmaster

You are so skilled with wild animals that it seems like you can read their minds and control their actions with just one look. It's hard to even imagine an ordinary beast attacking you.

   Weeks turn into months, a relentless passage of time that carves deeper lines of desolation into your soul. The tedium of daily existence merges with the suffocating loneliness and isolation, becoming an unyielding weight on your shoulders. Maybe before you thought it would be great to hide from the world like this... But as the moments stretch into eternity, reality reveals its true face - a merciless battle for sanity in your isolated shelter.

   Haunted by a gnawing unease, you find yourself obsessively checking the flashing indicators of external sensors and spending countless hours speculating about what cataclysm has ravaged this world and how dangerous it is here now. The Fusion that ripped the fabric of reality and turned your lab into a perfect bunker saved you, but has fortune smiled on anyone else? After all, it can't be that every single person died, can it? Right?

   Unable to sit still with impatience and driven by an insatiable hunger for the truth, you decide that if you don't notice anything dangerous, you will make a daring foray to the surface within a week. You need this recon mission before you go insane from loneliness and the unknown!

## What did you encounter outside? <span style="font-size: 15px; color: #ababab; text-align: right;">(Pick 5+)</span>



### Empty City

There are no people here, but you don't see any dead bodies either. It's as if everyone has just left and forgotten about this vast city. The streets are quiet and filled with the echo of your footsteps, but they have not yet been overrun by plants. This makes you believe, for a fleeting moment, that everyone is just gone for the moment or hiding to play tricks on you. But it's a vain hope; you know that this city is dead, and you are witnessing its last days.

### To Hell With Them

Ah, screw it! You've never liked all those petty people anyway! And this noisy city! Society was too depraved and mired in corruption; it couldn't be fixed anyway, so to hell with them all! You should look on the bright side of things! Whatever society emerges now will be better than the crap that came before! Oh, and yeah, you've always wanted to piss off the roof of the goddamn city!

### Raid for the Porn

There are many great things in the bunker, but... Damn, there's not enough porn with your specific fetishes! And soon all the magazines, disks and tapes will go bad! So you decided to make a special raid on video stores, sex shops and BDSM clubs. It's such a shame that the Internet doesn't work anymore... To find rare hardcore porn, you will have to search through thousands of houses, hoping to find some pervert's hidden collection! It won't be an easy task, but you have to do it!

### Skeleton Archer

Oh... shouldn't these be ordinary zombies? Slow, brainless corpses that are easily beaten with a crowbar? Well... Or at least fast and dangerous zombies that mutate into dangerous creatures... But today you encountered a skeleton with a bow in its hands! It even had remnants of armor that it was adjusting so they wouldn't fall off! What's next? Skeleton magicians? Zombie tankers? Maybe they'll even build a city for themselves!? This is much more dangerous than you thought! 

### Security Footage

Wanting to understand what happened in this world, you tried to find security footage and the latest news. You hoped it would make things clearer, but... This is... This is completely insane! It's just impossible! It's your memory, your consciousness is made up of jumbled memories from different worlds! You can remember fleeing from different apocalypses and that's fine... In some ways... But why the hell do you find evidence of all sorts of cataclysms at the same time?!?

### Parrot

A domestic parrot that had lost its owners has flown to you. It has missed people so much that as soon as it saw you, it flew and landed on your shoulder, begging for treats. This bird is incredibly smart. You don't know how it was lucky enough to survive, but you have no doubt that it could easily open its cage or even escape from the house. The parrot can say a few phrases at the right moments, as if understanding their meaning, and sometimes it repeats someone's horrifying screams of pain and suffering.

### Health Packs

Until you haven't found any people yet, but you know for sure that someone has survived. Maybe they are hiding in a safe place, fighting for their lives, or on their way... At least you have seen some fresh footprints. Anyway, you decide to help the survivors a little and hide a bunch of first aid kits and cheap ammo in various hiding places. Some shotguns, crowbars, chainsaw... essential tools that could mean the difference between life and death. This cost is insignificant for you, but it will definitely help any hero!

### Glory Hole

And to keep the survivors from getting bored, you've decided to organize the world's only glory hole! Of course, you can't just sit there for days waiting for visitors, so you'll have to install some state-of-the-art sex machines to start, but you're hoping that once this place becomes famous, survivors from all over the world will come here! You've even prepared separate rooms and supplies for those who choose to pleasure others here! Anyone can eat and sleep here, they just won't be allowed out until they've worked it off!

### Zombie Healing

You caught one of the prettiest zombies you can find. You somehow missed... uh... experiments! And one of the theories is that you can turn her back into a human! All you have to do is infuse her with life force. And the best way to do that is to use your sacred cock! Oh yes, you're generously donate her some of your energy, your life-filled sperm! Fill her to the brim, heh! All her holes! The first results of this experiment may not be impressive, but you'll definitely keep trying!

### Resort

You were amazed when you saw a secret resort in the warm water! Loud music, bright lights, naked and available girls - thousands of guests enjoying themselves as if nothing had happened! Unable to believe your eyes, you rushed there, but you were stopped by a powerful defensive field. No matter how hard you tried to get inside, you didn't have enough power to even draw attention to yourself. No wonder the resort had survived... When you returned a week later with additional tools, you discovered that the entire island had disappeared without a trace.

### Daemonettes

You met purple girls whose bodies were warped by mutations: extra breasts, tails, and claws instead of arms. It looked creepy, but you decided to talk to them. Surprisingly, they weren't worried about the mutations, but were having fun and joking around. They were clearly insane. You didn't understand what they were saying, but a minute later, you found yourself without pants, and they were already licking your cock and arguing which of them you would fuck first.... Ugh. It was the craziest, and hottest sex of your life! They squeezed you to the last drop, and went on, saying that they had to find some guardsmen...

### Whiskers

You track down a pack of wild monster girls. You're not quite sure if they've met before in this world... After watching for a few hours and deciding that they aren't aggressive, you approach them and they are actually happy to have you as their guest! But you stared at their tails and ears so much that the playful and shameless wolf girls started to tease you with their bodies. They allow you to touch their ears, look for whiskers, and even show you where their tails come from. All they ask in return is a thorough inspection and taste of you! Their rough tongues and tight pussies are incredible!

### Succubus

Damn it, you're caught in a magical trap! You were just about to free yourself when the ones who'd so insidiously trapped you ran into the room. Four young and very hungry succubi immediately fell to their knees in front of you and tore your pants off. They started sucking you so furiously that you didn't last a minute. After barely fighting over the first treat, they started sucking another load of cum.... And another... And another. You barely managed to escape until the third day when they had eaten enough and fell asleep without a care in the world. Oh, they seem to have sucked up all your sperm for months!

### Tooth Fairy

The Tooth Fairy is here for you! And she doesn't care that you have nothing under your pillow. She's bored because there are almost no people in the world and she has nothing to do! Not only is she not vulnerable like all fairies, but she's also surprisingly strong! She even knocked you to the ground and put on a boxing glove before you decided to play along. After a few playful punches, you pretended she knocked out your tooth and gave her a white candy. It worked! She amused herself for another hour until she was satisfied, and then ordered you to hide a tooth under your pillow every night!

### Demon Taming

You have prepared and managed to capture one of the demons! You're sure they're the ones who caused this apocalypse, but instead of torturing them, you've decided to tame and train her! Hm... no matter how much you whip her, she willingly exposes her ass and asks for more... But you taught her to lick your dick after anal! And give you a massage in exchange for a creampie! And kiss you when you bring her coffee in bed. And walk you on a leash in a chastity cage in exchange for licking her feet... Damn it! When you realized that she was manipulating you the way she wanted, you barely managed to kick her out of the bunker, but she promised to visit you again!

### Full Metal

You have discovered the laboratory of a prominent alchemist among the ruins. Among his notes, you have found a description of an ancient and forbidden ritual... He had prepared everything necessary, found the rarest ingredients and legendary herbs that only bloom once every hundred years, but he did not dare to perform the ritual. Well, you have moved all his records and belongings to your bunker, leaving only a granite monument in his memory at the site of his laboratory. Now, you only have to decide whether you dare to bind the soul of one of your deceased friends to this steel armor... 

### Demon Lord

You have met the Master Demoness! The one responsible for all the troubles and disasters! The one who started this invasion, summoned meteors, and raised zombies! She confessed herself when she challenged you to a duel... What? She generously removed her defenses for a fair fight? Hmm... her weak spot is her womb, and it can only be hit by a dick? Damn it, you must avenge her for this world, no matter what the cost! Oh yes, five hours later she acknowledged your heroic victory, even though you could barely move and she herself was riding on your cock! You saved the world, right? Hey, why are you challenged to a "duel" by another Demon Lord the next day? Damn succubi! You almost believed it!

### Futanari's Fuck Toy

You are ambushed by a group of Futanari! For the first second you were confused, because you didn't want to hurt them... But alas, it's too late. With their expert skills, they bring you down, promising to transform you into their obedient plaything. A massive Futa-dick penetrates into your tight ass, causing a mix of pain and humiliation as you scream and struggle against their overpowering dominance. As the minutes turn into hours, you can't help but succumb to the pleasure that begins to merge with the pain. Days blur into a blissful haze as you accept your role as their bitch... Oh, good thing you have the antidote to their addictive cum and can escape! 

### Shinigami Love Apples

You have some of the last apple trees in the world, but for some reason, all of your apples disappear right off the branches, and you don't even have a chance to taste them. You've already concluded that it's some kind of curse, and it would be easier to uproot all these trees and burn them. You even prepared the tools... But the next morning, you woke up hugging a rubber horse head and found a message written in red paint on your bedroom ceiling, explaining that the gods of death love apples... And it's hard to find real horses for threats these days...
Oh... It seems like you'll have to grow a whole apple orchard to keep them satisfied!

### Serial Experiments

You and your loyal AI assistant are fully immersed in science! GLaDOS is an impeccable helper. She is literally obsessed with science and experimentation! Not only does she have excellent control of the entire bunker so that you are not distracted by mundane matters, but she also has so many brilliant ideas! She wants to test so many things! 
Uh... Sleepy gas? Yeah, absolute...
. . . . . 
Damn, she decided to test your skills... again! You're also interested in your own body's abilities, but this time you have to escape a maze of traps and tests for a whole week!

### Flyers

As you grow increasingly desperate, you decide that if you can't find anyone, maybe you should try to make it easier for others to find you? But how do you do that? Just projecting a light into the sky like a beacon sounds like it might get you into trouble, so you decide to try something less flashy first. Like making a bunch of posters with directions on how to find you? Ugh...  The chances are slim, but you put up a few hundred posters anyway. Now you carry the remaining flyers around with you, and every time you climb to a high roof, you make airplanes out of them and launch a few into the distance for good luck. Who knows, maybe the survivors will find them?

## 

   You have been traversing the desolate wasteland for what feels like an eternity, searching for answers amidst the rubble and ruins, trying to figure out what has happened to this world. Perhaps it's the aftermath of the Fusion, playing tricks on your senses and conjuring hallucinations that dance on the fringes of your vision. It seems to have affected you even more than you thought... Are you slowly losing your sanity? You've already found clear evidence of several apocalypses happening all at once! It seems utterly implausible, defying all logic and reason! So maybe there is something wrong with your own mind? Are these hallucinations? Are there errors in your thought process?

   If only you could ask the people of this world; someone who has been through all of this! Fuck the apocalypse, you just need to talk to someone equal, otherwise you will definitely go crazy from loneliness! You would gladly welcome them into your bunker, providing them with sustenance, warmth, and protection... You would do anything for them, just to feel a little bit of human warmth!

## How did you meet?



### Looter

During another raid, you notice a small figure hiding in the ruins. You can't believe your luck and are afraid of scaring them off, so you decide to follow them for a while. It turns out that they're just going through someone's belongings, looking for something useful for themselves. It seems that after the cataclysm, looting has become as common to them as going shopping. When you call out to them from a distance and invite them to your base, they almost burst into tears, as they are just as desperate to meet other people as you are. 

### Resistance

Mankind may have fallen, but they have not given up and are continuing their fight against monsters and invaders! You hear the sounds of battle in the distance and rush to help. It is hard to describe the emotion and joy that fills you as you unhesitatingly join them in battle, back to back. Both of you have already forgotten what it's like to have someone's back and to rely on someone for cover. Of course, after defeating the monsters, you decide to stay together.

### Robinson

You discover them on a small uninhabited island in the sea. Their yacht crashed just before the cataclysm, so they have no idea what happened in the world. Of course, the rescuers never show up to save them, so they have to survive on this tiny island. Fortunately, there's plenty of fruit and water, so it's not difficult... However, the primitive living conditions, overwhelming loneliness, and desperate need for companionship have nearly broken them, so when they notice you, they rush to embrace you without even asking who you are or what you want. 

### Space Tourist

They faced the cataclysm in orbit. Completely safe and with a perfect view of the civilization burning below. Watching as everything they ever loved and cherished was destroyed... Other astronauts couldn't handle the desperate cries for help over the radio and the sight of continents engulfed in flames... They say these astronauts used the second shuttle, but you can see the terrible pain in their eyes and doubt that's true. They managed to stay in orbit to this day but landed in total despair, expecting nothing but a lifeless wasteland. Imagine their relief when they saw that you had come to meet them.

### Lost in Dreams

You met them in a dream. At first, you treat it as something ordinary and act like a total asshole and pervert, thinking it was just a dream... but they keep coming to you, begging and pleading for your help. They used their family's ancient artifact to escape disaster in the dream world, but they couldn't get out until someone performed the proper ritual. And they could only find you! When you summoned them back to the real world, you felt extremely ashamed of what you had done to them in your dreams... However, they forgave you and acted as if it had never happened. 

### Rescued

Normally, you would avoid the Orcs, for they are a resilient and powerful enemy. But this time you heard the muffled cries of someone... Of course, you couldn't resist and rushed into the orcs' lair! It was a fierce battle, and in the end you were drenched in their blood, but you managed to rescue some girls that the pig-faced ones were using for breeding. They were forced to keep birthing, which almost drove them mad, but you decided to care for them and help them heal. Later, they asked you to take them home, but one of them had nowhere to go, so she stayed with you.

### Sealed

When you discovered this well-fortified warehouse, you concluded that it was some kind of secret military depot. There was no light or electricity here, but instead there were heavy, powerful doors reinforced with runes, so you did not expect to find anyone alive... But in the central hall you found them. Caught in heavy runic pillories, wrapped in chains, and obviously having spent more than a day in total darkness, they did not look tired or worn out at all... They greeted you cheerfully and said that they had been captured and bound by demons! Or aliens? Orcs? ...you decided to save them anyway.

### Guest

You had spent weeks searching for people, but so far it had been fruitless... No, you didn't give up... You just decided to take a break... So when someone rang the intercom, you were drunk and almost missed it. But they were persistent! When you finally realized what the sound was, you rushed to the reinforced door and opened it, barely noticing that there was a person outside. Drunk, in your underwear and holding a bottle, you were so happy that you immediately fell on your knees in front of them like a savior angel and burst into tears of joy.

### Pilot

They faced the apocalypse thousands of miles away, at the foot of the northern mountains. They survived the first days in a cave, but then they had to hide among monsters and ruins... But they thought it was a local disaster, that cities and civilization must have survived somewhere! That they just had to escape and reach other people! They spent weeks clearing a small airstrip of monsters and struggled to fly the plane... But they never saw any living cities or people during the flight... And they were very lucky that you noticed that their plane ran out of fuel and crashed into the forest.

### On the Edge

They barely survived... Losing all their loved ones and friends... The sole survivor of the refugee party... They had hoped for something better at the end of their arduous journey, something beyond mere survival in a shattered civilization. But nothing changed, and with each passing day, despair consumed them more and more. To the point where they decided to end this all... By the time you noticed them, they had been sitting on the edge of the roof for over an hour, staring into the void. When they heard your voice, they burst into tears of overwhelming emotion and clung to the railing so tightly that it took you a long time to calm them down and pull them away from the edge.

### Seedbed

Many small tentacled monsters began to appear near your base, so you decided to deal with them. You burned these creatures for days and finally found their lair, a massive wall of living flesh in the basement that was constantly spawning new critters. As you were about to throw napalm on it, you heard someone cumming... In the following days, you had to cut through the flesh and fight the young monsters, but you found a girl who was being used as a seedbed. She gave birth to dozens of monsters every hour, endlessly orgasming as sperm and potions were poured into her. To save her from this nightmare, you gave her an amnesiac, so she won't recall it...

### Copy

In your search, you came across a ruined laboratory with experimental equipment. Of course, you couldn't just pass by, so you spent several days clearing the rubble and trying to salvage the surviving equipment. It seems that they were studying the human brain and consciousness, and made significant progress in that direction! Oh... In one of the rooms you discover a capsule with blood stains. Obviously someone was injured, but managed to crawl inside and activate the system... They even left a note saying that they are not sure if they will survive, so they are making a backup of their consciousness. They hope that one day someone will create a new body for the copy... Hmm! Actually, you can do that!

### Dropped

You couldn't believe your eyes when you saw a flash in the sky and a falling person. There were no planes, and the person definitely didn't have wings or a parachute... You were ready to scream in despair, thinking that they would surely crash, but... They fell very slowly and smoothly, so you managed to run a few kilometers and catch them in your hands. They didn't remember much about themselves. It seems they're from another world... They were playing some strange game, creating their own character, and accidentally activated "companion mode", whatever that means... It sounds like complete nonsense, but they immediately agreed to stay with you and become your friend!

### Frozen

You made a quick raid to the north, hoping that people could survive where all the monsters and zombies froze. But... no. There is no one here, and there is an infernal cold that instantly freezes your breath, forming snowflakes or freezing on your face. Not willing to give up, you spent several days and managed to discover the epicenter, where thousands of humans and monsters were frozen in ice. The figures stood as if they were still fighting, but they were all dead. Only at the center, in a gigantic column of ice, you found the one who activated the freezing artifact. Surprisingly, they froze so quickly that their cells were not damaged, and you will be able to bring them back to life in your laboratory.

### Resurrection by Erection

You never expected that this theory would turn out to be true, but little by little she became less and less aggressive, and soon she even began to enjoy your visits! You used all the magic and technology at your disposal to heal all her wounds, and she even tried to give you a head in gratitude! Oh... It was hard to decide, but you let her... And she didn't bite! Swallowing everything down to the last drop, she lost consciousness and woke up already healed, alive and warm, remembering all the days when she was a zombie and how you healed her... She feels incredibly embarrassed, but she understands that it was your lust that saved her and she should be grateful to you...

### Coma

This hospital has been badly damaged by an earthquake or explosion. The upper floors have collapsed, and the corridors are filled with hastily abandoned objects. Stretchers for patients, blood-stained bandages, torn clothes... It's amazing that there are no bodies or bones here... But in one of the basements, you have discovered a securely sealed room with a separate generator that is still working. There is only one person here, and according to the records, they are incurably ill, so they have been put into an artificial coma. But they are still alive, and with your current abilities... Yes, you will be able to cure them! Even if it takes months of research, you will definitely be able to do it!

### Present

It is Halloween, one of your favorite holidays. Of course, there will be no parties and fun this year, but you still carve a pumpkin, put a candle in it, and leave some treats for the spirits. You are not expecting anything, let alone presents... So you are astonished when you hear muffled groans and find a huge box with a fancy bow on it. Someone... Some very powerful spirit has accepted your offerings and gifted you with a companion! They remember only the first hours of the apocalypse and do not know how they ended up in the box, only vague fragments of memories of a strange rainbow world of spirits. In any case, you will have to spend a lot of time explaining the situation.

### Alone in the Dark

They were lucky enough to be underground during the cataclysm, so they remained intact. But... Days passed, and such terrible sounds came from the surface that they were afraid to even think of going outside. Soon all the batteries and the candles burned out... By this time, they find their way to an underground warehouse, so everything was fine, they had plenty of cans and water... But there was no source of light at all. In the pitch dark, monsters seemed to be everywhere, so they were afraid to go anywhere and spent all that time locked up, in complete silence and darkness. No wonder they almost attacked you at first, and then they cried for a long time, hugged you and apologized.

### Illusion of Normalcy

You found an anomaly among the ruins: a part of the city surrounded by heavy fog and perpetual twilight, untouched by the destruction. Streetlights illuminated the empty streets and stocked shops, but there were no signs of life. In the eerie silence, you could hear the footsteps of the lone individual moving through the city, completely ignoring your presence. They silently attended "classes" in an empty school, bought groceries, and returned home without uttering a word. Their refusal to acknowledge the apocalypse was so strong that it distorted the world itself around them. You spent a week with them until they finally struck up a conversation, and at that moment they broke down in tears, admitting that they could no longer deny the reality of the Apocalypse, and the barrier around them broke down.

### Always Been Here

You have searched so desperately, made so much effort... You have combed the wasteland for tens of miles, explored ruins and dark dungeons, cried and drowned in despair, gotten drunk at night, fought monsters... But... One day you just woke up hugging your ideal. Oh, you must have been out of your mind! How could you forget about them for even a second! How much you missed their smile, their warmth and tenderness, their endless love and care! Of course, your love has its own little quirks, and they always ask you to do everything for them and follow such a strict diet that you're not even sure if they eat at all, but you're willing to forgive them anything! You are even willing to carry them on your hands, especially since they seem to weigh nothing!

### Summoned

You became more and more desperate due to loneliness. Gradually, you began to drown your sorrows in alcohol, getting drunk every night. And this time you drank way too much... In a burst of drunken inspiration, you set up the portal device in an ingenious way. It seems that you wanted to travel to another world, or maybe create a portal to a brothel and order a dozen girls... But as a result of this insane experiment, which could have blown up your entire base, you actually summoned a companion! The only problem is that you pulled her out of a world where everything was fine and the apocalypse hadn't happened yet! Oops... As a result, the device broke a bit and all the brilliant settings were lost, and now you have to have a difficult conversation...

Hell, if you tell him that a kick in the ass is a traditional greeting in your culture, he will willingly present his butt for a smack every time!

### Yuri

In the past, she was a test subject in a very strange experiment. It's hard for you to imagine how it works, but her body was altered so that the more she suffered, the faster her regeneration worked to heal any damage. She was literally tortured day after day to see how it worked! It would be horrible... if she wasn't the most fucked up masochist you've ever seen. Hell, put a cigarette out on her nipple and she'll be begging for more and putting her clit on for the next one! A day later, there wouldn't be any trace of it left on her!

### Yoshi

Centuries ago, someone managed to trick this young, cheerful kitsune into being their servant.

So she hired herself out as a maid to an aristocrat and began to enjoy that life! When the apocalypse happened and she found herself alone again, she was desperate, thinking that all humans had died. So when she saw you, she immediately begged you to hire her! She is so happy to find a new Master!

That day he drank too much, even for a dwarf. He doesn't remember several weeks at all, but he came to himself surrounded by empty wine barrels, with a blood-soaked axe in his hands. And the lack of alcohol worried him much more than the stones falling from the sky... Well, Umighok has "minor" drinking problems, but he's such a good blacksmith that it's hard to believe.

### Ena Farralei

Her personal apocalypse began a few years ago. A bloody war in which she had to take up arms and learn how to kill. She always learned quickly... Endless battles, burning sacred groves, and cruel vengeance all froze her tender heart so that when the cataclysm came, she barely reacted. Perhaps she even felt relieved, for now she had no one left to take revenge on... and no one left to protect. Only emptiness remained in her soul, but she was too used to surviving.

When you found her, she sucked you off first and only then asked who you were.

But all in all he is a cheerful guy and knows how to stand up for himself, even when fighting in high heels.

### "Shadow"

The professional mercenary, he still prefers to hide his face and remain silent. You have never been able to find out anything about him, but his skills are so incredibly high that you are not surprised that he managed to survive even in the apocalypse. Melee combat, poisons, tactical and sniper shooting, even artillery and heavy machinery. He is a perfect fighter, and although he prefers to work alone, he can adapt to any group. You are confident that he is capable of single-handedly securing victory in the civil war of any small state. And he is ready to offer his services to you in exchange for a secure shelter.

### John Constantine

He has long known about the Dark Gods. He has been fighting their messengers for years in an attempt to save humanity, but it hasn't changed anything. In the end, he lost everything, yet somehow he remained alive. Maybe it's one of their wicked jokes? He drinks and smokes a lot, taking pointless risks as if trying to atone for some old sins or simply put an end to it all. One day, when he was drunk, he blurted out that it's surely all just some crazy game of the Dark Gods. Surely they will allow humanity to rise from the ashes, only to crush it again... And again... And again...

### Lain Iwakura

Just yesterday, you were sure that you had saved an ordinary little girl who had miraculously survived... But... She doesn't just have the ability to connect to computers, which could be explained by implants... She can even remotely activate a powerless, broken computer! Hacking any security, controlling cables as if they were alive, seeing what the user is doing through the screen even without a camera, and her own body often glitches from digital interference... Damn, are you sure you're not in the Matrix? Because when you look at her...

### Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon

It seems like you have completely lost touch with modern youth. A cute and beautiful girl, who you would expect to see at a fancy disco... With a huge scar on her face and a big sword on her back. She even introduced herself to you as some kind of medieval princess! These cosplayers have completely gone mad! Oh, did she really spend years learning to fight with swords? ...and to kill monsters? Wait. Is she a real princess!? Damn, you're starting to hate portals!

### YoRHa No.2 Type B

 This is one of the most perfect androids you've ever seen! Her butt is even better than the real thing, her soft synthetic skin is even heated and feels no different to the touch than a live one. Created to serve mankind, 2B will do anything for you. Whether you use her as a sexbot or send her on your most dangerous missions, she'll be happy to serve you and can handle anything! Even if she is destroyed, another copy of her, with all her memories, will come to you soon. The only thing she won't do is tell you where her base is.

### Ala Ali Alu "Swarm"

You have discovered only a few bodies from this experimental android swarm. They are connected through instant quantum communication, so even though the swarm has many bodies, they all feel each other's emotions and thoughts, and merge into something greater. You can create even more bodies for them, and they will all be happy to serve you. Oh yes, you got it right: it doesn't matter which android you fuck - they will all feel your cock inside them and climax at the same time!

### Kamilla Møller

She has such an amazing gift for taking care of plants and creating new varieties that you have checked several times if she uses magic... Almost nothing, just a slight trace, as if one of her ancestors was a dryad. But you are not sure that even a real dryad can simply approach and stroke a predatory plant-monster! However, for Camilla, they are no more dangerous than a hamster, and she is even willing to hug them! And something tells you that it won't be long before she plants dozens and hundreds of plants in your bunker and around it.

### Teru Cheadeenn

She was given to humans by aliens during the recent contact. Teru is not just an ordinary slave, her whole race has been in sexual slavery for thousands of years and sincerely enjoys it. Their bodies have been significantly enhanced, they don't get sick, can easily withstand the toughest conditions, heal any wounds, and still remain remarkably tender and sensitive. And when all her owners died, when she became free for the first time and had to decide for herself what to do... Oh, it was so awful! So Teru willingly gave you her leash, hoping that she would never have to make decisions on her own again.

### Elysia "Sacrifice"

She must be out of her mind if she thinks these crazy and cruel Dark Gods care about her prayers. But she was probably the only one who looked forward to their arrival and rejoiced in the apocalypse they bring. She often performs dark, lustful and violent rituals... In which she is always the victim. She likes nothing better than to be beaten and raped in their name. Surprisingly, it seems to work... Even the monsters just rape her and let her go, as if these gods enjoy her show and don't want it to end.<p style="color: #b20004;text-align: left;font-size: 128%;"><b>Hobby:</b><span style="color: #cbcbcb;text-align: left;font-size: 78%;"> Prayers, ceremonies, converting others to her faith</span></p><p style="color: #b20004;text-align: left;font-size: 128%;"><b>Kinks:</b><span style="color: #cbcbcb;text-align: left;font-size: 78%;"> Free use, pain, humiliation, ritualized violent sex.</span></p>"Hey, don't hold back!

### Ragnar "Blackthorn"

It may seem ridiculous, but you have managed to meet one of the legendary heroes of the past. Damn, everyone thought it was a fairy tale about ancient gods and heroes... Ragnar, the one who joined the gods in the battle against the Titan and was rewarded with a sip of water from the River of Eternity. Immortal, who has lived for tens or even hundreds of thousands of years. He's not really into new technology and trendy gadgets, but he's unbeatable in hand-to-hand combat. Oh... And he really cannot be killed...

 Well, she has the gift of necromancy, what's the big deal? Dead and spirits follow her everywhere, ready to serve her, so what? Does she have to be forever gloomy just because of that, wearing a black tattered cloak and wishing death upon the living, huh? No way! Chrape is one of the most cheerful girls you've ever seen! So much so that even her zombies look joyful, love to joke around, and smell like flowers! Oh, and of course, she won't be living in a cemetery! She will happily live with you, bringing light and happiness into your life!

### Enginseer Octavian "Cv-36"

He has so many implants, both electronic and mechanical, that at first it's hard to tell he's a human and not a robot. It seems that Octavian is just crazy about technology and considers it the highest good. He literally worships and prays to machines! And, oh damn... It seems to work... At least you have definitely seen broken machines start working in his presence... Could it be that you are witnessing the birth of a new religion amidst the ruins of civilization?

### Jinx

 When you find her, she is not just mentally devastated. She's in such despair that you're surprised she hasn't gone mad... Completely. She is a brilliant weapons inventor, a great fighter who kills monsters by reflex alone, and she believes that she caused the cataclysm. She thought that her rocket would at most explode a part of the city... But it seems she underestimated her own invention, or it was just a coincidence that the apocalypse started at the same moment... She destroyed everything that was dear to her and is convinced that she is cursed and will bring misfortune to others.

## 

   Oh damn... it seems that the way the Fusion has warped your mind, your Grotesque Perception is much, much worse than you thought before. You've already gotten used to how disgusting and grotesque the world looks to you, you've even managed to paint the bunker in colors that at least don't make you sick. You thought you could somehow adapt and go on living because it's just a visual effect... but damn... You didn't expect that living people would be so disgusting to you.
 

### Parushta

This is just ridiculous... you can barely tell the difference between him and the monsters. Long legs, a huge stinking maw whose putrid stench you can smell from a few meters away. Did he call itself "Parushta"? What the hell does that even mean? Is that a name? It's so hard to make out that slurping sound.... Damn, your hands are clutching the weapon too obviously... Oh, is he pacing? Is he running? Hey, you weren't gonna shoot, were you? Maybe it's for the best, though...

### Manish Idhant

A disgusting mass of flesh... You seem to say that too often, but ughhhh.... You see it everywhere. And this freak doesn't even look humanoid. It's like a giant meat jelly, pulsating with rot and waste. And worst of all, you see one eye looking at you intently... You realize that what you're really looking at is an ordinary human being... most likely. And that it is not the world that has become a gutter full of rotting corpses, but your own distorted consciousness that is turning everything around you into a stinking mess.

### Omi Takahata

Ugh... You can hardly believe that this... This pile of disgusting flesh, this living embodiment of abomination is a human being. Eyes scattered all over the torso and living slimy outgrowths... hell, you can barely keep yourself from throwing up your breakfast. The sounds coming from that toothy cavity in the head... You can barely make sense of them, but... is it a girl? No... no... it can't be!

### Roger Baro

Oh, and it even resembles a human! You can even make out some sort of face... Well, actually several grotesque faces at once... But still, it seems like you could live with this monstrosity, and you wouldn't even gag at the sight of it! Hey, hey, wait! Did you really say that out loud? Sorry! Oh... he... he really is a freak, caught in acid rain? Damn... you... you hope he'll come back...

### Slooobhhrg

It just can't be human... No... You didn't even try to understand what it was saying. You just threw it a first aid kit and some food as a gesture of goodwill, tried to force a smile that turned out to be more of a grimace of disgust, and hurried away. It's so monstrous that you seriously consider blindfolding yourself so you don't have to see this distorted, sick world around you. But even then, you'll probably never be able to live with humans... What a monster you've become...

### Saya

Your despair has reached a point where it can no longer be called depression. The will to live has almost left you, for even with your eyes blindfolded, the world around you remains grotesque and repulsive. A sick world without any trace of beauty... However, a glimmer of hope is ignited within you when you hear a melodious song echoing through the empty city. That voice. It is the most delicate and exquisite voice you have ever heard. Unable to believe it, you rush to the source, inadvertently startling the singer who hastily hides. In a state of panic, you begin to scream, desperately calling out to her, begging her to reveal herself! In a moment of desperation, you throw away your weapon and fall to your knees, uncontrollably sobbing. And then, at that very moment, she appears... The most stunning girl you have ever seen! 

## What pet do you find?



### Granite

This living rock is slow on the uptake, but for some reason it really enjoys following you around. Of course, you can't invite it into the bunker - it just won't fit, but Granite is as patient as... a rock so it'll have no problem waiting for you outside even for years.

## 

   You're absolutely ecstatic about finally encountering another living, sane person and developing a friendship with them. Months of loneliness, fear, and uncertainty have taken their toll on you, leaving you exhausted. But now, you can't stop talking and your joy is uncontainable, as if you were a child on the most wonderful party. Your face is adorned with a silly grin that refuses to fade away. Their excitement matches yours, as they can't contain their delight in your company and your fantastical bunker.

   However, there's a part of you, accustomed to observing, analyzing, and organizing everything, that surreptitiously begins to study your new companion.

## How loyal are they to you?



### Utterly Devoted

You feel that they are completely loyal and obedient to you, ready to do anything to serve you and be helpful. They will carry out any of your orders without hesitation.

### Conditional Loyalty

Now their loyalty does not cause any doubts, but of course they are living people, and you feel that everything will depend on how you behave. Take care of them properly and you will have no more loyal ally.

### Selective Loyalty

They have their own dreams, goals, and ideals that are very dear to them and that they will not betray. Sometimes they will act in their own way, but first, they will try to talk to you.

### Vocal Dissent

They often express doubt about your decisions and even go so far as to try to debate them. They often act independently, either to prove themselves right or because they think you're wrong.

### Hesitant Betrayer

It seems that they liked your bunker and your belongings much more than they liked you... You will have to explain to them the necessity of every order, and you feel that they can betray you for their own benefit.

### Manipulative

They often try to manipulate you covertly, using you as a mere instrument to carry out their own agenda. Or they may do so simply to improve their own quality of life or out of habit.

### Mistress

Even if they respect you and consider you in charge, they think it's perfectly natural to dominate you in bed. And they will do their best to make you enjoy every moment of being their obedient toy.

### Dominant

They will always dominate you sexually, no matter what the situation is. It's just part of their nature, and they think it's perfectly natural that you belong to them and that they can do whatever they want with you. 

### Fading Loyalty

Over time, they will come to see life in the bunker as something to be taken for granted. So you will need to find ways to reinforce their waning loyalty and show them who is in charge.

### Confirmation

They believe you've saved them just for sex. So if you don't use them, they'll think you're about to kick them out, and they'll do everything they can to get fucked by you, to confirm their right to be here.

### Falling in Love

They fell in love with you at first sight, and they have no hesitation in expressing it to you openly. Every day, they eagerly share their feelings with you, hoping for a response from you.

### Secret Love

Their hearts burn with love for you, but their shyness prevents them from confessing their feelings. Sometimes, trying to hide their emotions, they behave like an overly excited schoolgirl.

### Best Toy

They will never admit it, but they have a dildo that is an exact replica of your cock, and when they are alone, they spend hours with it, imagining you fucking them. Don't ask how they got the dildo...

### Clingy

They have a strong fear of being alone again and prefer to follow you everywhere like a puppy. Even in the shower. And if you don't let them in, they'll scratch pitifully at the door.

### Yandere

Nothing can stop their love for you, not even yourself! They are willing to overcome any obstacle just to be with you! They are so devoted that they will even bind you if necessary to ensure you won't run away!

## 

   You begin to live together, relishing the joy of each other's presence. A steadfast companion, a soulmate... It's something you have yearned for, but never truly believed possible. It seemed like an exaggeration in the stories you read and the movies you saw. Yet now, you find yourself overwhelmed with emotions and sheer bliss!

   As time goes by, you delve deeper into each other's lives, uncovering the intricacies that make you who you are. Perhaps not every aspect of their character is flawless, but you embrace them wholeheartedly, embracing their imperfections and all.

## What is their character?



### Adventurous

They have an insatiable sense of adventure, constantly seeking new thrills and excitement. This makes them the perfect companion for anyone looking for an exciting escapade.

### Friendly

They are really friendly to everyone they meet and try to see the best in people. Of course, you are a special case and they smile at you even more! 

### Optimist

They always believe in the best outcome and look at things with optimism. After all, even after the apocalypse, they stayed alive and even met you!

### Joker

They have a great sense of humor and love to joke around and cheer up everyone around them. Sometimes they will spend a lot of time and energy on an elaborate prank!

### Awkward Jokes

Sometimes they can't help but make a joke at the most inappropriate moment, and some of their pranks leave you confused. Sometimes you don't even understand if they are joking or not. 

### Brat

They'll often pretend to screw up or lose something very important just so you can give them a good punishment. And of course, they're counting on something sexy!

### Good Girl

They would do anything for your praise, for you to pat them on the head and call them a good girl. They even purr like a cat for it!

### Makeup

They are obsessed with their appearance and spend hours on their skincare and makeup. They always strive to look their best for you.

### Surprise Enthusiast 

Surprises? They love surprises! Gifts, pranks, unknown dishes! Hey, they'll be happy even if you grab their ass unexpectedly! And of course, they'll try to surprise you themselves!

### Sarcastic

They have sharp tongues and often use sarcasm or wit in conversation. There are no taboo topics for them, and they are ready to discuss and ridicule anything. 

### Drama Queen

They tend to exaggerate the situation for dramatic effect and to draw attention to themselves. Theatrical gestures, showing tears, hugging, or whatever! 

### Shoulder to Cry On

They just love to cry on your shoulder. So much so, that sometimes they purposely make up a reason for it. Oh, they don't mind at all if you grab their butts or do something else to entertain yourself during that time.

### Shy

They are extraordinarily shy and blush and stutter easily over anything. It's so cute! Especially because even though they are shy, they still go on with their act.

### Bored

They are often very bored. They've lost old hobbies like watching TV, and they have no one to call or write to, so they come to you and demand that you entertain them somehow.

### Unlimited Energy

They are always full of energy and like to be active, rarely sitting still for long periods of time. Even when standing in one place, they will dance a little and often come up with various fun activities.

### Dreamy

They are hopeless romantics and spend most of their time daydreaming. They are ready to plan your dates, imagine what you could say to her in this or that situation and how cool you would look!

### Highly Emotional

### Fear of Darkness

They have always been afraid of the dark, and now there are no more flashlights in the world and real monsters lurk in gloomy places.

### Tentacle Phobia

They don't want to talk about it, but seeing tentacles literally shakes them. Even a tiny octopus can seriously scare them!

They're pretty darn cute when they're a little freaked out! So much so that you'll want to scare them over and over again while enjoying their squeals!

### Prettiest Part

They are constantly staring shamelessly at your crotch, smiling dreamily and not even trying to hide it. And don't even dream of embarrassing them by taking off your underwear!

### Clumsy

They don't want to seem too dangerous, so they regularly pretend to be clumsy and awkward in a peaceful environment. It's a bit fake, but still very cute!

### Heat

They call it heat, but you're not sure if that's the right term... Anyway, they get really frustrated when they don't serve your dick for a week. 

### Nudist

They think their body is flawless and hiding it is silly, especially from you. So they never cover up after a shower and generally prefer to walk around the bunker naked.

### Ding-a-Ling

On some whim, instead of calling you with their voice, they prefer to jingle the bell on their choker to get your attention. Especially when you're already looking at them!

### Overestimates

They often overestimate their capabilities and persist in trying even when it's obvious that something is wrong. The huge dildo doesn't fit in her ass? She just needs more lube...

### Always Smiling

They always smile for you, even if they secretly hide their sadness and pain. Maybe they don't want to show weakness, or maybe they don't want to spoil your mood.

### Threatening

For whatever reason, whatever they are doing. It looks very threatening. Even if they are just peeling vegetables, the knife in their hand seems to be the most dangerous weapon of all.

They are truly terrifying when they get angry. So much so that you can even see a special aura around them! Even monsters prefer to run away when they see them in such a state, so you better start apologizing right away!

## What did you find out about their body?



### Flexible

Every time you see how they can bend, you can't believe your eyes. It's almost like they have rubber bones! Not even the Kama Sutra describes the positions they can get into!

### Elastic

You could tease their nipples, gently pulling them back a dozen or so inches, and their eager holes ready to gently accept whatever you decide to put in them, while requiring the perfect amount of effort for penetration.

### Alcoholic

They prefer to be at least a little drunk at all times. Because when they're tipsy, it's so much easier to ignore what's going on outside. Additionally, they become more uninhibited and cheerful with alcohol! 

### Junky

They will plead for heavy drugs to escape reality and enter a world of illusions and dreams. Oh, sure, you can do whatever you want to their bodies as long as you keep them drugged!

### Lightweight

They're very easy to get drunk. They have a low tolerance for alcohol, but are completely unable to refuse when someone offers them a drink. As a result, parties with them can often lead to hilarious and unexpected drunken antics.

### Pigtails

They clearly envy succubi for their convenient horns, so they often wear pigtails, preferring them over any other hairstyle. After all, this way you'll have something to grip onto and hold them during sex!

### Lunatic

Or they're very good at pretending! Either way, sometimes they'll come to you in the night and in the morning they won't even remember it.

### Hairy

Their pubes are adorned with a bit hair, which emphasizes their maturity. They embrace it and won't shave it off even if you ask them to, but they take good care of it!

### Gaped

They really don't want to talk about what happened to them, but their anus is extremely stretched. It's not causing any issue, but you can put both hands in at the same time. 

### Self Harm

On their bodies, you can see the myriad of self-inflicted cuts that bear witness to moments of inconsolable despair. They may insist that all is well, but sometimes new wounds appear...

## What additional skills do they have?



### Military Training

They have military training, are skilled with weapons, and work well as a team, so they definitely won't be an annoying burden during raids. 

### Close Combat

They rarely use their hands in combat, but their foot kicks are so powerful and fast that they could be considered black belts in some martial art.

### Hands-on Craftsman

They enjoy working with their hands and love to fix things or invent something new. They rejoice like a child when the gadget actually starts working!

### Quick Analysis

They were unusually accurate and quick to assess the situation. If the fight couldn't be won, they might even give up and immediately start lubricating their ass to make it less painful. 

### Runner

To outrun a horse? Ha, they are so incredibly fast that it seems like they could even catch up to a motorcyclist! In your previous world, they would definitely be world champions in running!

### Gamer

They are great at all kinds of games! Maybe not on the first try, but they can defeat even the toughest boss, even if the character only has a basic weapon! 

### Artist

They can create breathtakingly detailed and lewd hentai! Any kinks you want! The trick is that they use their own bodies as models, so it's also a lot of fun to watch the process!

### Aftercare Master

They are so good at aftercare that you will be willing to endure even the most extreme play for the sake of it. Furthermore, the more they exhaust you, the more pleasurable their embrace will be afterwards!

### Dancer

Ballet, oriental and club dancing, go-go, striptease and other erotic dances - they are experts at it all! They are amazingly skilled with their bodies and sincerely enjoy your gaze as they dance.

## What curses do they have?



### Living Weapon

They are a living and very powerful weapon. In order to unleash their full potential, they must surrender completely, body and soul, to their owner. 

### Spiritual Connection

Somehow, as soon as you touch each other, you've mentally connected and now feel each other's genitals as your own, regardless of the distance. 

### Cock's Slave

They are cursed to be completely submissive to anyone who fucks them. Just touch them with your cock, and they become your slave as long as you're horny.

### Twerking

Honestly, you're not even sure if it's a curse or if they just like it so much when you stare at their ass that they try to draw more attention to it...

### Forever Late

They have a terrible habit of always being at least a few minutes late, regardless of the circumstances. There's no point in trying to set an earlier time to meet; it's as if they can sense this trick...

### No Panties

Any panties they put on immediately disappear somewhere, and any pants or dresses turn into a short sheer skirt. But they're used to it and don't mind, letting everyone stare at their ass.

### Bondage Doll

Bondage is so calming for them and helps them relax from freedom that if they don't spend at least five hours a week being bound and under someone's complete control, they can fall into depression.

### Cat Girl

She is cursed and will turn into a cat if she is not fucked regularly. She has already grown ears and tail and is very scared, so she will beg you to bang her. Especially since she gets in heat once a month.

### Mystery Pregnancy

Despite the bunker's defenses, something raped her. She remembers nothing, but now she is pregnant with a strange creature. During childbirth, the creature will disappear and remain a mystery to you forever.

### Dark Teacher

Sometimes you can notice a dusky shadow behind them, seemingly guiding and instructing them... Its intentions and true goals remain unknown, but as time passes, their trust in this dark mentor deepens...

### Mutations

The cataclysm has caused significant and obvious mutations in them. They look very strange, but are fully functional and do not prevent them from living normally.

### Futa

They have a very sensual, juicy and tempting mutation between their legs... Or are they big dick futanari from birth? Who cares, all that matters is that it's a lot of fun! 

### Big Tits

Their breasts had grown to an unimaginable size, but their bodies had somehow adapted to it. So even though these huge boobs are heavy, they don't cause any discomfort or pain.

### Horns

They have a pair of strong and very sensitive horns growing on their heads. They are hell-bent on playfully bumping you until you grab their horns with your hands for full control.

### Possessed

They are possessed by an unholy and insanely lustful spirit. Sometimes it takes control and does unimaginable things to their bodies until you banish it with the holy cross or your penis.

## 

   It was inevitable, and you both knew it. The insatiable hunger for human warmth and the undeniable need for intimacy consumed your every thought. And so it was, as the flame of desire burned brighter and hotter, you found yourselves in the same bed.

   At first, a tentative hesitation hung in the air, casting a veil of anticipation. But soon the floodgates of desire burst open, unleashing a torrent of unfulfilled fantasy and unbridled desire. Every touch, every whisper sent surges of electricity through your bodies, igniting flames that could only be quenched by the intoxicating pleasure you shared.

   In this sacred space of exploration, boundaries were blurred and inhibitions dissolved, unlocking the depths of your hidden desires. Secrets were peeled away, layer by delicate layer, revealing the raw, unadulterated essence of your true selves.

## What extra kinks do they have?



### Always Top

They just like to look down on you. Even if it's you raping them, forcing them and playing with their bodies, they'd rather be on top, even if it means getting more of your affection.

### Pet Owner

They always dreamed of having an obedient doggy... They are willing to spend hours playing and grooming their pet, training it, and taking care of its every need~

### Good Morning

Your morning boner totally mesmerizes them, so they're ready to wake up early to welcome it! You are still sleeping, but your dick is already so hard! How can they resist kissing it?

### Size Queen

They prefer only the biggest toys and dicks! Not just the ones that stretch them beyond their limits, but also the ones that they can only hug and rub their whole bodies against!

### Fisting

Big dicks are great, but they also love having someone's hand inside them. Feel their playful fingers go as deep as they can! See their belly bulge!

### Anal Enthusiast

Their anus is an unusually sensitive erogenous zone, so they will willingly put it under your cock and even ask you to play with it more often without restraining your desires!

### Oral

Their tongue is super sensitive and they adore your taste, your smell. They are ready to kiss for hours, lick your body, suck your fingers and, of course, worship your cock and balls!

### Deepthroat

They prefer not only to suck your cock or hold it in their mouths, but to feel it as deeply as possible in their throats. To enjoy the way it stretches them, to gasp and choke, to feel the tears that flow from this pleasure!

### Tied

Actually, being tied up and helpless is always a little scary, even when you're tied up by someone you trust completely... But it turns them on so much that it's impossible to refuse!

### Hidden

They often tie and lock themselves up in the most unexpected places. If they disappear somewhere for a whole day - just listen, you will probably hear their muffled moans under the bed or in the closet.

### Cosplayer

They love to have sex in cosplay. They also have completely different behaviors in different costumes, depending on how they are portraying the character.

### Drunk sex

There is nothing better for them than wild and rough drunken sex. Get wasted with them and screw them so hard that their moans and screams will be heard by the gods themselves!

### Disciplining

She knows she's not good enough yet, and loves it when you train and discipline her. You can train her all you want, she'll be happy to be the perfect sex slave for you.

### Sex Toy

She sees that her body is just a sex toy for you and enjoys that idea. So please pay no attention to her desires, just use her body as a cheap onahole! These hot holes are made for your dick!

### At Your Service

They want to serve you with their bodies. When you don't just fuck them like a sex doll, but treat them like a thing, just a coaster for a glass or even an ashtray.

### Cum Eater

The taste of semen intoxicates them and gives them extraordinary pleasure, so they will not only willingly swallow every last drop, but even accept as a gift a full condom that you have fucked someone else in.

### Cum Dump

They believe that their true purpose is to be cum dumps, to take a man's cum. They may try to hide it, but just a little pressure and they will give in to that desire.

### Uncovered

They have a truly bizarre way of covering their naked bodies. They can't resist "covering" their nipples and spreading their legs a bit to get a better view, even in front of a stranger.

### Secret Sex

For them, the best sex is in the most dangerous places and positions, where they can be caught at any moment, so even when they experience the most powerful orgasms, they have to hold back their moans.

### Being Caught

Secrets are good, but the moment they get caught masturbating, they come the hardest! This shame is incomparable, so they never close the door! Sure, they'll pretend it's an accident, but you'll catch them quite often!

### Face Play

They are very cute looking, but for some reason they are just crazy about being called a pig and having their pretty face painted with markers, wearing humiliating stretchers, and being poked with dicks.

### Belly Budge

They like to keep unimaginably huge anal beads inside them so that their bellies swell up like a pregnant woman. Of course, you can always pull them out, you don't even have to ask!

### One isn't Enough

They don't slow down for a second during sex until you cum twice. The first load of cum is just extra lube! And right after an orgasm, you just get more pleasure, right?

### Milking

They are obsessed with your orgasms. They don't care about their own sensations, they just want to milk you, to see every last moment, to feel your cock tremble in their hands and to hear you moan.

### Breeding

She wants kids. Lots of kids! She doesn't even care who the father will be, she just wants to feel life in her belly, to fulfill her feminine destiny!

### Live Bet

They are just crazy about the idea of being a stake in some card game. They are happy to gamble on their own body with you, but they dream of you putting them on the line like an object in a game with someone else.

### Tentacle Mania

Dozens of tentacles can satisfy anyone, or so they say. Oh, be careful, because they'll definitely try to sneak some monsters into the bunker and hide them under their bed!

### Tentacle Witch

They are so adept at handling tentacle monsters that it seems they are commanding them rather than being raped... Oh, the tentacles even make coffee for them...

### Free Use

They believe that their holes are yours to use whenever and however you want. The fact that they themselves are busy doing something else is no reason for you to stop!

### Second Role

They like to have sex with you, but they really dream of not being your main lover, but just an assistant who will humiliatingly serve you, only hoping for a reward rape. 

### Abandoned

Instead of receiving any kind of aftercare, they prefer to be tossed around like a used sex doll. To enjoy sore holes, leaking semen and the realization of their own worthlessness. 

### Do It Rough

Oh, to hell with tenderness! Grab them so they can't get out and shove your dick in as hard and rough as you can! Let them enjoy your power!

### Little Toy

They love to feel your overwhelming strength and power, to realize that they are nothing but a fragile toy in your hands. To feel your hands on their necks and realize that their lives are completely dependent on your will.

### True Masochist

No man can ever be rough enough for them. Even passing out from the pain they will dream of more! Just take care of a good cure and you can have all the fun you want with them as brutal as you want!

### Danger

They enjoy the violence against themselves, the sense of danger and hopelessness so much that they cum like crazy when they feel a real threat to their lives.

## What will be the rules <s>in your harem</s> for your companions?



### Welcome Ritual

It's pretty obvious that you should take a good look at anyone's body before you let them on your base... It's just common sense!

### On a leash

This is your bunker and your rules. Whether they like it or not, everyone in there now has to wear a collar and a leash!

### Remote

It's not a silly whim or perversion at all, you just want to be able to make them feel good anytime! Just press the button and make them cum!

### Master's Reward

They are forbidden to cum during sex with anyone other than you. Even if you let your friends use them, they will still be severely punished if they cum from someone else's penis. 

### Permission

They can only cum with your explicit permission. Even if you never find out, they will feel terribly guilty if they secretly cum and ask for punishment themselves.

### Silencer

Fun chatter is great, but sometimes you just want to enjoy the silence. So, they are obligated to put on a ball gag at your first request, it is no offense, just a little respect for your wish. 

### Storage

Of course you enjoy their company! It's just that sometimes there are too much of them... Luckily, you have a little room where you can always put them away for a while. It's got vibrators and food - everything they need!

### Tamagotchi

With this device, you can always see the status of your companion and know their needs. And when you press the "Pet" button, they'll even feel that you care!

### Hypno App

You've created a little app that can control their arousal and amplify their kinks! So handy! Want a blowjob? Just press a button and they'll be dying to blow you!

### Strict Rules

Oh yeah, punishments... Well, for not following the rules, they will be punished very severely! No ice cream for a week! And maybe you'll even spank them!

### Double Fun

One companion is great, but why don't you look for more people? You'll probably have a lot more fun together!

### Triple

You've got plenty of room here, surely you can search for more people! You have to help them! And it's definitely not because of your dream of a tower of juicy asses...

### Harem

You have to catch them all! Uh, you mean save 'em! You're going to save as many people as you can! Well, uh... Okay, you can definitely take on four... No, five companions! Maybe six?

### Best Friends

All of your companions will be remarkably friendly with each other and will almost never fight. In any case, they are sure to make up no matter what.

### Like a Sisters

They will even think of each other as half-sisters or brothers! Their bond will be unusually strong, and they will even understand each other half-heartedly, like real relatives.

### Lovers

Oh, they seem to love each other a lot more than you thought... They'll never completely forget about you, though sometimes you'll feel like an extra.

### Competing

They will always compete with each other in everything they do, trying to prove to you and each other that they are better! Sometimes it will look completely absurd, but it actually matters to them!

### Cat Fights

Despite their friendship, they will sometimes argue and even fight, mostly because of your attention. Just show them that you love them all! ...or enjoy the show.

### Bullies

From time to time, they bully each other and even team up, but the balance of power changes quickly and the bully can become the victim the next day.

### Synchronized Heat

All their cycles are synchronized, so sometimes they all have a "headache" and other days they all burst into your room together!

### Shared Responsibility

Punishments for all offenses will be applied to everyone at once, so they will be watching each other and reminding each other of the rules... Or enjoy their punishment together!

### Dedication

The harem seems to have developed its own little traditions... Each newcomer must undergo an initiation into their friendly company! This dedication is a secret even from you!

### Training

When you're busy with important business or just going on some traveling, they won't waste any time and will get plenty of training!

### Growing Harem

They need more friends! So they will catch and train the newbies themselves! And they are so good at it that after a month the new girls are ready to catch newcomers themselves!

### Introduction

Only when the newcomer accepts themselves as your bitch will they be introduced to you. And so they can prove themselves for the first time, you'll be hold up so you can't resist!

## Tulpa

   In a desperate attempt to alleviate some of the nasty effects of the  Fusion, you decided to take medication to stabilize your fractured consciousness. At first, everything seemed fine. The waves of anxiety subsided, the intrusive thoughts receded, and the phantom voices faded into the void...

   But...

   Suddenly, the chilling realization hit you like a lightning bolt - your companion, along with the other hallucinations, began to vanish into thin air. Could it be that, consumed by loneliness and driven to the brink of despair, you had conjured them up out of sheer madness? Were they mere figments of your deteriorating mind? Those cherished days filled with happiness suddenly crumbled into fragments of delusion, leaving you teetering on the precipice of your own insanity. 

### Treatment

Your heart is breaking with pain and despair. But you have no choice. You decide to continue the treatment, no matter what the consequences. Even if you cry and regret it for the rest of your life...

### Throw It Away

Anxiety? Illusory sounds? Ha, what a small thing! To hell with this treatment if it's costing you your love! You gathered up all the drugs and threw them away, wrote in your diary that they were ineffective, caused terrible headaches and memory loss, and then took a big dose of amnesiac, wanting to forget all this and enjoy life with your mate again!

### Talk About It

It's weird, but you feel like you just can't decide their fate on your own..... You're so used to thinking of them as real person that even now, when you realize they're just your hallucination, you decide to talk to them. Ask them for their opinion on what you should decide. This will probably be a difficult conversation...

## Curing

   You realized long ago that you couldn't do anything about your grotesque perception, so you stopped trying.  The world still appeared to you as the inside of a decaying behemoth, but you had painted the bunker in a way that made it somewhat bearable. And with Saya by your side, her gentleness and love made you forget everything.

  One day she mentioned that she had studied the human brain... She believed she could possibly cure you, claiming it wouldn't be that difficult... For her.

   However...

   Saya confesses that she is not exactly human. Yes, she has read many books and has a deep understanding of people, which makes it easy for you to interact with her. Yes, she loves you more than anything in the world... But now you see her as a beautiful girl only because of your distorted perception. She enjoys being seen that way by you, and she is willing to be your lover until the end of time. But once she heals you... once you see who she really is... you will no longer be able to be together... She will go away and be alone in the world again...

### Refuse

Of course, you had already guessed that she wasn't human, it didn't come as a surprise to you... So it didn't take you even a minute to decide. 
No, of course not, you refuse! 
She means the world to you! Saya saved you from the worst despair, brought light and true love into your life, so how can you push her away, leave her alone? No, you love her so much that you are even glad about this damned apocalypse and your illness, because thanks to it you met her! So to hell with this cure, let the whole world rot and ooze filth, as long as she's with you, you're happy! 

### 



### Accept

You are so tired of this constant nightmare. So tired of seeing the monster in the mirror, of seeing even the walls rotting like old flesh, of smelling that disgusting stench... 

You love Saya, but you're so tired that you agreed to her proposal without even asking how exactly she plans to cure you. The risk? Who cares, even if you die, it's better than this disgusting world...

## Chapter 6

- = Loot = -

## 

Together you continue your raids on the surface. Finding people in this desolate and monster-infested world is damn hard, but there are plenty of abandoned and unneeded things here. Shops, houses, storage facilities and secret bases... As is often the case, these things have outlived their owners, but this time they have been inherited by the wasteland and oblivion.

You stock up on essentials and smirk at the windows of once expensive and unattainable stores. Gold, luxury... Now it means nothing. You don't even pay attention to fashionable clothes of an unfamiliar style, trying to find something unique and valuable for yourself among the ruins. Experimental technologies, rare equipment... You delve into the most secret places and sometimes discover artifacts, anomalous objects whose principles of action you can't understand... But that doesn't stop you from taking them and using them!

As you try to make sense of this world, your confused and fuzzy memory tells you that in this world, humanity has chosen the path of advancing magic rather than technology. After all, why build machines when you have golems? And who needs guns and tanks when mages can create a firestorm? You could definitely call this world "High Magic". Well, or maybe you should add "Fantasy", since other worlds have dreamed up such wonders of magic? Anyway, who cares about these terms now? What difference does it make if society is already in ruins and there is only post-apocalypse? 

### Time-Looping Hourglass

With this pendant you can make the 25th hour of the day for yourself! It will take you back one hour into the past, but you can't meet yourself or create time paradoxes or the spell will break.

### Arcane Focus

### Spellbook

This is the personal diary of one of the great mages of the past, and it is full of great mysteries and arcane secrets. If you can only understand it, you will surely master powerful spells!

### Broomstick

This seemingly ordinary broom has been enchanted by a powerful witch. It can arrive on a whistle, and there's even built-in protection against mosquitoes and wind!

### Inquisitor's Helmet

Used by the High Inquisitors for hundreds of years, this helmet has absorbed so much holy energy that the undead and demons tend to flee from anyone wearing it.

### Concubine Costume

A full concubine set increases your charisma beyond belief. So much so that dirt won't even stick to you, and dicks all around you can feel you through walls!

### Concubine Costume

Hell, you just wanted to try it on for fun, but it's cursed! You can't take it off! Hell, you can't even pick up a weapon and have to seduce all your enemies!
