=== ORIGINAL CHUNK ===
 cursed armor is possessed by an evil spirit that craves battle and blood. You will feel no pain or fatigue, it will make you fight even with broken bones to the point of death, and it will allow you to go far beyond your limits.

### Parasitic Suit

This costume will fuck you without stopping for a second and feed off your orgasms! What does it do in return? Well, uh... if things get too dangerous, it'll take control and help you escape from wherever you are, so it can keep fucking you safely!

### Bikini Armor

The protective field of this armor is stronger than that of an entire fortress, it is very lightweight, and it does not interfere in battle. However... um, the way it attaches to the body... 

### Soulbound Swords

You will never forget these paired swords at home, for they are attached to your soul. The intricate tattoo only helps you summon them, but over time you will learn to summon them directly into your hand.

### Phoenix Feather

A wizard tried to put a real phoenix feather in the core of a magic wand that promised to be incredibly powerful, but he failed. After all, how to put a feather of fire into wood? But if you can do it...

### Dwarven Boomstick

You'd call it a regular revolver shotgun... If it wasn't reinforced with runes and used explosives instead of gunpowder for insane firepower! Hell, some ship cannons have less power!

### Rings of Power

Heh, you managed to loot a jewelry store with enchanted rings! While there are no legendary artifacts here, you now have sets for every occasion! Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Resistances!

### Chaos Potion

Every possible spell and property has been mixed into this potion, so it is absolutely impossible to predict its effects. But something tells you it's better to be a few miles away from where it falls....

## 

Together you continue your raids on the surface. Finding people in this desolate and monster-infested world is damn hard, but there are plenty of abandoned and unneeded things here. Shops, houses, storage facilities and secret bases... As is often the case, these things have outlived their owners, but this time they have been inherited by the wasteland and oblivion.

You stock up on essentials and smirk at the windows of once expensive and unattainable stores. Gold, luxury... Now it means nothing. You don't even pay attention to fashionable clothes of an unfamiliar style, trying to find something unique and valuable for yourself among the ruins. Experimental technologies, rare equipment... You delve into the most secret places and sometimes discover artifacts, anomalous objects whose principles of action you can't understand... But that doesn't stop you from taking them and using them!

When you try to make sense of this world, your confused and fuzzy memory tells you that magic and electronics weren't used in it, but instead were developed to the extreme of mechanical skill, creating amazing machines. Isn't this the kind of world that should be called "Steam Punk"? "The Age of Steam"? Oh, who cares about those terms anymore? What difference does it make if society is already in ruins and there is only post-apocalypse?

### 10-Second Clock

This device allows you to transport your mind 10 seconds into the past. Your body will be in the same place, but you can try again and again until you get the result you want.

### Plasmids

You found some experimental serums from deep-sea creatures that should affect dna... They're supposed to give humans superpowers, but they haven't been fully tested.

### Multispectral Goggles

These glasses will not only allow you to magnify objects, but also see the world in different spectra. You'll be able to see ultraviolet, heat, even sound and radio waves!

### Oiler

This oiler somehow miraculously makes the lubrication an order of magnitude better. It's like an improved WD-40 that can handle anything!

### Interworld Compass

You found it in the lab of one of your old friend who also worked with portals. With this compass, you will always be able to find your way back to your bunker, even if you find yourself in another world.

### Pneumatic System

It seems they were developing pneumatic systems here for maintenance... Ah, no matter how you look at it, it's clearly a pneumatic tentacle... And they'll fill any hole perfectly!

### Monowheel

 A strange vehicle where you find yourself inside the wheel... Except you don't have to run like a hamster! And, by the way, it can go anywhere. 

### Steam Tank

It's clearly a custom tank model with a whole bunch of cannons and machine guns. Normally you need a crew of 10, but here everything is fully automated.

### Airship

You managed to locate and repair an empty airship that got caught in the trees. It's surprisingly easy to fly, even in strong winds.

### ODM Gear

A complex system of pneumatic harpoons and winches allows you to soar on cables, clinging to buildings and giants. If you know how to use it...

### Deep-Sea Suit

In this suit, you are so completely isolated from the environment that you can even dive to the bottom of the ocean or spend a short time in space.

### Tesla Coil Armor

Tiny but powerful tesla coils will allow you to generate a powerful field that will electrocute everyone around you and even release small lightning bolts from your hands.

### Flamethrower Suit

There's nothing better for fighting nasty monsters than a blazing flame! A special system and fuel will allow you to burn everything around you for hours! 

### Power Arms

Usually gloves like this are useless because a person just can't wear them, but this model somehow balances the weight and effort so you can use them with full force!

### Guard Bot

This steam-powered mech is surprisingly agile and fast, but it clearly lacks built-in cameras and internal screens for the pilot...

### Chainsword

Some madman not only made a chain sword, but attached a gas burner to it so that the saw would be red-hot during battle!

### Super Shotgun

It's just a big caliber shotgun, but sometimes you think it's some kind of magical annihilator... Because no matter what monster you shoot at, it just disappears!

### Steam Pistols

These pistols are connected to a backpack with compressed steam and bullets, so actually you can fire them almost like two machine guns!

### Wraith Grenade

Someone has managed to seal death itself into this grenade! Well... Or a hundred wraith, which is pretty much the same thing, since they'll rip the soul out of anyone. Better throw it far, far away!

### Spider Bomb

Not only is it a bomb in the form of a tiny spider that reaches the enemy before exploding, but it also has the ability to make thousands of copies!

Together you continue your raids on the surface. Finding people in this desolate and monster-infested world is damn hard, but there are plenty of abandoned and unneeded things here. Shops, houses, storage facilities and secret bases... As is often the case, these things have outlived their owners, but this time they have been inherited by the wasteland and oblivion.

You delve into the most secret places and sometimes discover artifacts, anomalous objects whose principles of action you can't understand... But that doesn't stop you from taking them and using them!

As you attempt to make sense of this world, your confused and obscure memory suggests that magic was not used in this world, but it also lacked the opportunity to advance its technology to perfection. Aren't these worlds usually called "modern"? Such a strange term, but wouldn't the inhabitants of each realm consider it modern in their own context? But what does it matter now when it lies in ruins, consumed by a post-apocalyptic state? 

### CIA Access Key

It allows you to bypass literally any password and open any electronic door... Damn, so those weren't rumors about secret chips in all electronics!

### Adrenaline Shot

It's not just adrenaline here, but a complex cocktail of combat drugs that multiplies your abilities for a full hour. After that, it'll be a nasty withdrawal for days.

### Fetters

These special anal plug cuffs are designed to restrain the most violent criminals. Hard to resist when you risk tearing your own anus!

### Doomsday Library

In the house of a mad survivalist, you find a tiny laptop with a unique library of books. He's been collecting them all his life, clearly preparing to revive civilization after its collapse.

### Bravery Potion

An entire warehouse of top-quality 40-year-old courage potion. Ha, with this, no nightmares or phobias can scare you! The most important thing is not to get wasted! 

### Hazmat Suit

A full-body suit designed to protect against biological and chemical hazards, with advanced air filtration systems and hermetically sealed joints to ensure safety even in the depths of a nuclear reactor.

### Assault Armor

It's hard to run around in this assault armor, but it can protect you from explosions and even point-blank machine gun fire. It comes with thermal vision, filters, and radio.

### Ghillie

At first glance, it appears to be a mere heap of worn-out, ordinary scraps. However, this suit is ingeniously crafted to allow you to blend seamlessly into any environment, evading even military drones. 

### Sneakers

Ha, why would you even want to fight when you can simply flee from all your problems? The key is to choose the right footwear, and these sneakers make your feet feel like they have wings! You're 20% faster wearing them! 

### Tinfoil Hat

It is undoubtedly one of the forbidden inventions. For decades, propaganda has tried to convince everyone that it's ineffective, but the tinfoil hat actually blocks psi waves!

### Jetpack

The secret military jetpack uses only one liter of fuel per hundred kilometers, but it won't be easy to make this tricky fuel... But there are a few tanks here that will last you a while.

### Vespa

This seemingly ordinary scooter is not only fast - it has no speed limit! Absolutely! Oh, but it does have a lot of breakdowns, so it's a bit of a maintenance nightmare.

### Tank

Ahaha! It's always so satisfying to drive a tank through a crowd of zombies! It's a steel behemoth that can crush anything! And the built-in nuclear reactor will last for years!

### Batmobile

Looks like this car belonged to a crazy billionaire or something... It's unbelievably cool, has a built-in machine gun and missiles, goes to 200 km/h in 2 seconds, but damn, it needs good roads!

### Yellow Submarine

It's not too fast or spacious, but it can dive to any depth and has a bunch of the most advanced sensors! And hell, it's very comfy to live in!

### Crowbar

It has unimaginable destructive power and allows even a normal scientist to make 3 hits per second! Just a minute of fast blows and anyone can destroy even a tank or break through a wall!

### Knuckles

Simple at first glance, these spikes are made from an incredible alloy and sharpened to the atomic level. They will easily penetrate even hardened armor steel.

### Ak-74

A true legend among guns! The Ak-74! Some genius survivalist in his madness managed to make this super-reliable weapon use any type of ammunition. It can even be loaded with pebbles!

### Milkor

This grenade launcher has a unique add-on that allows you to somehow adjust the strength of the explosion. From a firecracker to 50 pounds of explosives!

### ZF-1

An experimental weapon equipped with three machine guns, rockets, a flamethrower, a net, and even a self-destruct system. Who the hell built this thing!?

But that doesn't stop you from taking them and using them!

As you try to make sense of this world, your confused and hazy memory tells you that in this world, electronics and technology have advanced to the point where they are almost indistinguishable from magic. You could probably call it "Sci-Fi", because in many other worlds, this is the kind of thing they can only dream about and write fiction about. Or maybe "Diamond Age"? Anyway, who cares about those terms now? What difference does it make if society is already in ruins and there is only post-apocalypse? 

### Anomaly Detector

Equipped with hundreds of state-of-the-art sensors, this detector can detect any anomaly and even spotlights artifacts!

### Portal Gun

Wow, a compact portal gun! Amazing device, the main thing is not to accidentally fall from a great height.... You might want to wear a parachute or something.

### Psionic Amplifier

This helmet will be able to concentrate and amplify your innate psi abilities many times over. Even a normal person will be able to lift a hundred pounds while wearing it!

### 9D Object

It may look like a strange cube, but bet most of it is hidden in other dimensions. You can only guess what it really is and who created it.

### Holographic Atlas

This device not only creates a map of everything around you, but somehow shows you what's happening on it in real time. Even areas you visited months ago.

### Anti-Gravity Wings

You definitely won't need to flap those wings like a butterfly, as they create an anti-gravity field around you. But if you really want to...

### Wasp

This super-sonic bike will make you feel like you're riding a damn rocket! And it feels fucking awesome! Protective force fields? Oh, don't turn it on, it kills all the fun!

### Goliath

A huge bipedal battle platform with missiles, cannons and machine guns! All-purpose fighters that will take on anyone! Hands? Why would a mech need arms if you can add more cannons?

### Tachikoma

A lightweight reconnaissance and battle droid with full AI and cloaking field. It is very playful, curious and eager to learn, as well as an excellent hacker and spy.

### Swordfish II

A space fighter with incredible maneuverability, its main cannon fires only four times per minute, but can penetrate the shield of a heavy cruiser.

### Hev Suit

A protective suit designed for the toughest conditions. It will protect you from anything as long as your batteries are full, even a shot from a tank!

### Power Armor

Standard space marine armor, you've managed to find a couple of suits that managed to stay intact even in the ruins of a ship that fell from orbit. In it, you're ready to kick even Superman's ass!

### Holographic Disguise

It's almost a magical cloak of invisibility! It will make you practically transparent in all spectrums, especially if you don't move.

### Resuscitator Suit

There are so many medical supplies and built-in gadgets, there's enough for an entire hospital! With this suit, you could even transplant a kidney in the field!

### Hackers Hands

Uh... No, it's not tehno tentacles! It has too many sharp plugs to attach directly to any device or cable! Don't push them into anyone! ...except cyborgs and meha girls?

### Light Sabers

Hey-hey, a couple of lightsabers at once! Pure plasma that can cut through almost anything! And it looks like you got lucky with the color!

### Smart Hand

Some madman has built a full AI into his combat prosthesis to shoot faster and more accurately. It has the mind of a dog, ready to fight anyone and missing its former master very much.

### EMP Grenades

These are small grenades that don't even split when they "explode," but their EMP pulse is comparable to a small nuclear blast and will fry any unprotected electronics for miles around.

### Shock Gun

This "harmless" humane weapon is capable of producing a shock pulse that, like a stun gun, electrocutes anyone within a hundred meter radius of the energy pulse.

### Graviton Beam Emitter

One of the most devastating weapons you can imagine. It unleashes a powerful beam of concentrated gravity that destroys everything in its path for dozens of kilometers.

## 



### Reality Anchor

After your mind was nearly torn between worlds, you decided to create a special bracelet that would keep you attached to this world. As long as you wear it, you cannot be banished or teleported.

### Emergency Portal

It's an amazingly simple spell that will get you out of any trouble! The only problem is the halfway point in the form of a tentacle realm where you'll have to stay for a few days before you return to baseю.

### Phylactery

This ancient phylactery has the power to split your soul and resurrect you when you die. Essentially an extra life! Actually, there was already a Necromancer's soul here, but you decided you needed this phylactery more!

### Shibari Rope

This rope is so soft and silky that you couldn't resist tying yourself up as soon as you found it... Damn, it's cursed! Anyone who sees it will try to tie themselves up! So just close your eyes and throw it to your enemies!

### Memory Prism

Anyone can record their memories on this crystal to relive them or show them to someone else. It's pretty easy to use, and who knows, you might even learn how to transfer skills?

### Harlequin Costume

This stupid costume is so ridiculous and absurd that no one will ever take its wearer seriously. Whatever you do will look like a stupid and harmless joke, even if your hands are covered in blood.

### Bag of Holding

It's actually your own bag, it's just that you threw it away the first day and forgot about it. But the Fusion has made it completely unfillable! Except that the things in it can change, and sometimes you even find your own notes that you didn't write...

### Cupid's Arrows

Oh, you really hope Cupid just lost some arrows you found, and not died in the apocalypse... Either way, they don't hurt and disappear after they hit, and a person falls in love with the first person they see.

### Curseward Dildo

It is actually a powerful amulet that is shaped like a penis, as it provides the best protection being inside the body. And it was impossible to make it smaller... But sitting on it, you can safely work with any cursed object!

### Pervert Glasses

These glasses don't see through clothes, they show the deepest and most secret fetishes, something a person is sure to like, even if they don't realize it yet!

### Wormhole

It is interesting why so many geniuses turn out to be pervs? Even you have so many kinks... Someone created a working wormhole, but made it automatically connect to genitalia!

### Flying Dildo

Seriously? Someone created a flying golden dildo that "attacks" your enemies and anyone you point it at!? Why not a flying sword!? But at least it's sure to distract anyone.

### Gem of Power

The magical power of this crystal is simply unimaginable! It is as if it has no limits! Yes, you literally have to have it inside you, and its size... Ugh... Looks like you're going to need some practice if you want to become the greatest wizard! 

### Obedience Collar

The person in this collar retains all of their will, but their body obediently follows whoever is holding the leash. Even if you take them to a sex dungeon to rape them!

### Black Flag

With this flag, you can raise morale and lead anyone into battle against tyrants and villains! ...or any other powers, because rebellion is what matters!

## Chapter 7

- = Trapped = -

## 

   Feeling bold, you began to roam the surfaces for whole days. A few monsters, a few anomalies - you haven't encountered anything too dangerous. You became too relaxed, thinking that nothing threatens you here; That the whole world now belongs to you...

   Until one day, during a raid, a dreadful shadow storm erupted and out of nowhere, you were attacked by a huge pack of ferocious critters. It was the first time you had ever encountered such monstrous beings, and even with all your training, you were unable to handle them. Barely escaping with your life, you lost all your loot and some of your stuff. The long-forgotten panic from the first days resurfaced in your soul as you, wounded and bleeding, stumbled back into your bunker. You activated all the security systems, but you were still trembling in terror, fearing that these creatures could track you down. What if they set up an ambush? You had left so many trails around your base lately...

   No one attacked the bunker, but even after the healing, black fear kept you from coming to the surface. After all, too little time has passed... Surely there are still plenty of dangerous anomalies, mines, traps, monsters... Yeah, that's right! You should just wait in your bunker for a while, you don't need to go to the surface at all! You can have a great time together with your companion! And you can learn new useful skills in complete safety! 

   A few years would be enough, wouldn't it?

## What did you decide to do inside? <span style="font-size: 15px; color: #ababab; text-align: right;">(Pick 12+)</span>



### Reading

You've been wanting to read some books for a long time, and now you have plenty of time to do it! Huh... You could probably even read a few thousand books...

### Cooking

Why not treat yourself to a delicious and healthy meal? You have to eat anyway, right? And this way, you can use that time to become a great cook!

### Courtship

You are no longer alone and you are so happy to have someone by your side that you decide there is nothing better than tenderly wooing and seducing your partner, making them enjoy every minute with you!

### Kama Sutra

You have plenty of time for fun, so you decide to try every possible position for sex, try every fetish and perversion at least once! Ha, maybe you'll even write an addendum to the Kama Sutra!

### Bunker Radio

You wanted to spend time choosing the perfect music, but you got so carried away that you decided to start broadcasting your radio station! Let your favorite music be heard all over the world!

### Graffiti

To decorate your bunker, you decided to cover all the walls with your drawings. Your favorite anime characters, landscapes, abstract patterns, the best scenes from hentai! Soon it will be a real art gallery!

### Machine Language

To really understand machine logic and improve your programming skills, you decided to learn how to communicate using only binary code. You'll be beeping a lot, but you'll be avoid all mistakes!

### Gaming

Lots of free time? Boredom? Hah! You have tons of video games! Even if there is no network and only you, your buddy, and the bots are online, you can still play games for years!

### Lucid Dreaming

You may not be able to go to the surface, but there's nothing stopping you from delving into your own dream worlds, is there? Oh, at least you hope the monsters haven't learned to hunt there yet...

### Cross-Stitch

Hmmm... in the old days, many women, even noble ones, enjoyed needlework, didn't they? Isn't it interesting? You decided to check it out and learn this skill.

### Maze

You decided to strengthen the defenses of the bunker even more and build a real labyrinth inside! Some of the walls even move, making it impossible to find a way out!

### Chorus

Sentry turrets make funny squeaks, and armored doors can make a bassy buzzing sound with their servos, so you decided to create a real chorus of them! Soon your whole bunker will be singing in unison! 

### Balloon Twisting

Uh... You are so bored already... But clowns were invented to entertain people, right? So you decided to become one! Well, at least learn some balloon twisting!

### Ball Tricks

You're going to learn some tricks with your balls. Oh... you mean with a regular ball! Although, uh... Maybe you should learn how to retract your balls?

### Table Pennis

You've gotten so bored with regular sports that you've decided to come up with new challenges for yourself! Like playing ping pong with your dick!

### Duck Army

Driven by sheer madness, you decided to create an entire army of squealing rubber ducks, each equipped with a motor and explosive charges. Their attack would be epic!

### Tins

You should know what you're eating! So you decided to memorize the names of all the canned goods in your bunker! Their full composition and exactly how much is left!

### Transformation

Heh, you're just as good as the magic girls! You even learned how to magically transform clothes just like them! Well, uh... Kind of... 

### Dance Band

You were so damn bored that you spent weeks catching some cockroaches and teaching them to dance in sync with the music.

### Sloth

Ugh... Something to do, something to learn... Screw it, you're too lazy... You'd rather just lounge under the kotatsu with your mate...

## 

   It has been over a year since your imprisonment. You still fear to go outside because the external sensors have detected shadow monsters that can sense the presence of living creatures and patiently wait for you. Of course, the loneliness no longer drives you mad, but... Recently, you have been engaging in some rather strange activities to deal with the unspeakable boredom... Maybe you are not cut out to live in a bunker for years? Or perhaps humans cannot endure such isolation.

   You have been thinking a lot about how the apocalypse and the anomalies have distorted the world. Are there still people on the planet? After all, they cannot all be dead, right? With billions of people, there must be places on other continents, mountains, or islands where everything is not so bad... Theoretical calculations suggest that the density of anomalies should not be the same everywhere, that the dark influence will fade and over time the world will become safer. Perhaps humanity will not be able to maintain civilization and will lose knowledge; they might even revert to savagery. Mad marauders, medieval barons, or even primitive tribes... You do not know how far civilization will decline, but you are confident that humans will find a way to survive. At least, you fervently hope so, because man has proven himself to be the ultimate predator, capable of surviving in any circumstance.

   One day, humanity will undoubtedly be reborn, but you are doomed to live in this post-apocalyptic world. You spend the rest of your life locked in a bunker or, if you ever decide to venture out, even if you manage to defeat all the monsters, amidst abandoned and deserted ruins.

   . . . . .

   Or maybe not?

   Surely you will not dare to use the Fusion again, for the fact that you are alive and sane is a mere stroke of luck, one in a hundred billion, but... Your bunker is an incredibly reliable place that can last a hundred years. You just have to find a way to skip that time and stay alive!

## How did you skip time? <span style="font-size: 15px; color: #ababab; text-align: right;">(Pick 1)</span>



### Philosopher's Stone

You have managed to unlock ancient mysteries or delve into the depths of alchemy on your own, and in the end you have successfully created the Philosopher's Stone. Unfortunately, it is not infinite and depletes quickly, but it will certainly last you for hundreds of years. All that is left is to take a bit of a sleeping potion...

### Mimic

Mimics are known to take great care of their victims, raping them for as long as possible... And you're convinced that an ancient Mimic can even reverse aging! All you have to do is find one and put an amnesia implant, so you won't remember what it did to you... As long as you don't remember anything, it's okay, right?

### External Organs

Alchemical treatises state that the cause of death lies in the blood... You cannot find enough blood to transfuse, but you can create flawless machines to purify it! You are sure that once you remove all impurities and achieve a perfect blood composition, time will have no effect on your body! However, sitting for years might not be very comfortable, so you should take care of that...

### Cyborgization

The flesh is weak! At least you're sure you can create a much better, ageless replacement for your body! You can even build in backup and emergency systems that will take care of your brain even if most of your body is destroyed! Yes, your body will no longer be able to regenerate itself, but it will still be much faster to repair! And one day you may even invent a self-repairing system...

### Time Experiments

You are so impatient and unwilling to wait all these years that you have decided to test one of Tesla's boldest theories. It says that if you create an anomalously powerful electromagnetic field that is super dense and overwhelming, it will distort time itself! And if you find yourself inside that field, you can almost instantly move forward several years! All you have to do is repeat this experiment several times! 

### Cryostasis

Usually, if someone wants to keep something from going bad, they just freeze it... Eh, it's not as easy with people as it is with meat, but the principle is similar. If you lower the temperature below zero, but don't let the water in your cells crystallize, you'll practically stop aging, the main thing is to make sure your capsule can successfully unfreeze you after so many years... Maybe it would be safer to wake up every few years to fix and check things?

### GMO

Probably the easiest thing to do would be to genetically modify yourself so that your cells never age and always return to their optimal state... Here we go, one shot and you won't age anymore! But you'll still go crazy from boredom in the bunker... So you've created a machine that will perfectly store your vacuum-packed body and keep you anesthetized! Huh, your companion actually believed it was necessary to take this silly position!

### Clone

Hmmm... If you think about it, your consciousness is just a program recorded on your biological brain... So even when your body dies... Hmm... Yeah, well, you could just make a clone of yourself and put your consciousness on his brain! It's a bit tricky and scary, but if you set it up right, years later an automatic system will create a clone and fill its consciousness with your memories! Theoretically, there will be no difference between him and you!

### Mind Uploading

On the other hand, why would you even need a clone when you can just digitize your consciousness and become something like an AI? If you simulate your own brain perfectly, you won't even feel the difference! You can even emulate hormonal emissions to maintain "real" emotions and not become a cold, calculating machine! Huh... Perhaps you should make yourself a humanoid body first, so you don't go crazy from being inside a computer...

### Stasis

Actually, you already have a system that's almost perfect for "time travel". A stasis field to store food! You just need to increase its reliability a bit and add protection against cosmic rays... You don't want alpha particles damaging your cells while you're standing in stasis, do you? Oh, and you need to duplicate the shutdown timer several times... A hundred times. Or a thousand, just in case!

### Soul-Sucking

Through hard and long research, you were able to figure out exactly how succubi feed and suck energy! Oh no, you couldn't learn how to do that, but you were able to create special sexbots! All you have to do is create a few dozen succubots and release them on the surface to bring you enough horny-energy! The main thing is that the real succubi don't find them, or they'll definitely get pissed off...

### Resurrection

This may sound too daring, but you don't have to stay alive... All the time. You mean that resurrection brings a person back to the exact age at which they died, right? So if you want to move forward in time... You have to die. Because a corpse doesn't age! This coffin will resurrect you, and you are 99.9% sure of it. You set it up so that if anyone tries to open it or damage it in any way, it will initiate the resurrection ritual.

### Black Hole Magic

You are definitely out of your mind if you believe in these absurd calculations... but... You've checked them dozens of times! If you create a pair of overlapping portals in close proximity to the event horizon of a supermassive black hole... even though you will travel from one to the other in a fraction of a second and gravity will not be able to tear you apart, decades will pass on the planet in that time! Oh, there's just one small detail left - tuning your portal system and not destroying the planet...

### Cup of Eternity

In time, you realized that these beings between worlds, the Dark Gods, were not necessarily pure evil. Perhaps they could be seen as one of the laws of nature or something... You tried to research them and were surprised to find that the oldest and darkest books described rituals that allowed you to touch their power. Liters of narcotic potions, months of wandering through the most violent and insane nightmares, and you were able to discover their Dark Temple, which can be found in every soul. Just one sip of darkness from the cup of eternity and your body will take their power...

### Meditation

You tried meditation to calm and restore your mind... But you did it so well that you decided to take it a step further. After all, there is nothing more healthy for the body than pure Prana, which nourishes it perfectly, cures it of all diseases, and even restores youth! Legends say that yogis have been able to meditate for thousands of years, so surely you can too if you try hard enough! The main thing is not to get carried away, not to go too far on the path to enlightenment, and not to forget to return to the body!

### Reincarnation Ritual

You've come up with the perfect plan to pass the time, get out of the bunker, and find people at the same time! It even guarantees that you'll make friends with them! If you prepare your soul in a certain way... Oh yeah, you'll have to die, but that's nothing... so if you prepare your soul properly, you can reincarnate with all your memories intact! Of course, you'll probably be born somewhere far away and have to grow up all over again... But it could be a great experience, and then you could just go back to the bunker!

## 

   You spend a long time contemplating how long to set the wake-up timer.

   Five years? Ten years? No, of course not, that's definitely not enough. In that time, even small communities won't have formed, and people will still be scavenging for resources in the ruins.

   Twenty or thirty? A new generation of humans will have grown up, born after the cataclysm. According to your calculations, the number of anomalies should have significantly decreased by then... Or maybe humans will have adapted to them and learned to recognize danger in advance. Either way, there'll still be a damn small number of people.

   Maybe two or even three generations then? If people start having 8-10 children again, like in the old days, then the population could increase a hundredfold, even with the losses taken into account... Sure, the first cities or enclaves will start to emerge... But would you be interested in living in a small town among those who have lost most knowledge of the past era? After all, education requires schools, teachers, and the community must be able to support them, which would be quite expensive even for a population of tens of thousands. Not to mention universities, factories... Even with a strong and intelligent ruler, imposing high taxes would be difficult, and without technology, people wouldn't be able to produce enough food and goods... It would essentially be the Dark Ages with illiterate peasants and petty wars over small villages...

   So what is the alternative? Should you try to wake up several centuries into the future, when civilization will have already been established? Maybe your bunker can survive that long, but... Heh, is it really fun to wake up and find yourself under the rule of some foolish king? You have grown accustomed to freedom and being in control of your own destiny, and you have power and an incredible bunker! You possess not only the knowledge of the previous civilization, but also technologies from other worlds! If you awake at the right moment, you can not only build your own city or even kingdom, but also help to revive civilization! Hell, you could even change the course of history! Fix all the terrible mistakes of the past world and make mankind better! With your abilities and powers, this is more than possible!
 
   Inspired by this idea, you even rejoiced in your involuntary imprisonment, because this way, everything will turn out so much better! One hundred years! You will awaken in a hundred years, when there will be enough people to create cities, and all you have to do is organize them!

## Chapter 8

- = Future = -

## 

   Awakening after a long, very long sleep, you first make sure your companion is okay, then you start checking the bunker systems. To your relief, everything is fine, with minor glitches that the system can handle on its own, and there haven't been any major disasters in the last hundred years. Even those shadow creatures that nearly killed you haven't been spotted for decades.

   Happy that everything is going according to plan, you immediately prepare for an expedition to the surface. It's time to find out how the world has changed in that time!

## What did you find in the world? <span style="font-size: 15px; color: #ababab; text-align: right;">(Pick 10+)</span>



### Grand Desert

The surface around your shelter has become a vast rocky desert for hundreds of miles. Maybe it's the fires or the climate, but sometimes it feels like you're on another planet. Building a civilization here and restoring nature will not be easy...

### Great Rift

It seems that the continent broke in half during the cataclysm, and now there is a huge crack running across the continent. It's many kilometers deep, and in some places you can even see lava at the bottom. In one place, someone has built a bridge, and it's a clear sign that people survived.

### Ruins

It seems like no one ever tried to fix or change anything. Hell, there weren't even any marauders here, nobody ever looted the houses and shops... Even the things you dropped a hundred years ago are still there... Everything is still where it was, only now it's rusted or falling apart.

### Bright Nights

Oh, okay... It seems like last time you got a little carried away... NOW, you definitely feel like you're on another planet! It looks like it's just a mist with some luminescent spores and glowing mold, but it looks cosmic! These bright nights are the best you've seen in cataclysm!

### Global Flood

The water level in the world's oceans has risen significantly, or maybe some parts of the continents have sunk lower, but many cities, or rather their ruins, were deep under water. Uh, you're really lucky that your bunker is high enough not to be flooded.

### Fungi

A fungal infestation has transformed the landscape, creating bioluminescent groves and fungal forests. In the first few days, you were afraid of getting infected by the spores and wore a mask, but your research has shown that they are not only safe, but actually boost your immunity.

### WTF!?

The world around you changed so much that it was more like a bad trip for you for the first few days, so you couldn't even understand what the hell was going on around you. Why is someone fighting a giant crab on stilts!? Are they even human or not!?

### Storms

 It seems that even after a hundred years, the weather remains quite fierce. Right before your eyes, a bright sunny day turns into a raging storm with hundreds of blinding lightning strikes and powerful rain showers. The wind is so strong that it uproots some trees, yet within just an hour, the sun is shining again.

### Time Loops

 Time loops and anomalies are now a common phenomenon, creating a world in which events repeat and intersect in unpredictable ways, challenging your understanding of cause and effect. Once you even met an entire city from a past world, but you could never get near it...

### Ghost Town

Some souls simply refuse to leave the earth and pretend to be alive. If in the past you encountered them individually, now it seems that they got tired of being alone and gathered together, organizing their ghostly city. Well, here you will always have someone to reminisce with about the past world... 

### Military Base

Among the mountains you discover an old military base. There are no people here, but the local reactor is still full of energy and many security systems are still working. You're in a hurry now, but later you'll come back to take control of this base. You're sure to find weapons for an entire army here, and you can't leave it to the enemies and scavengers.

### Fairies Everywhere

You noticed some fairies in your bunker, but you didn't pay much attention to them... After all, these little buggers have gotten in before, but damn... There's a hell of a lot more of them in the world! In the past, you could go your whole life without seeing a single fairy, but now there are several mischievous groups flying around in every grove!

### Builders

In the past, you sent construction bots to rebuild the city for you and keep it from collapsing, but ..... It seems that they've learned to create new bots to build even more efficiently. Over the years, they have managed to turn most of the continent into one giant city, not caring if anyone lives in it or if it falls apart.

### Floating Islands

 You haven't figured out what this is all about yet, but some pretty big floating islands have appeared in the seas! Could it be some kind of particularly light volcanic pumice? Or some kind of special algae? Either way, it looks like the sea landscape is a lot more exciting now.

### Rebellious AI

AI-GLaDOS

### Mafia is Immortal

You can hardly believe your eyes when you see mafia vampires in fancy suits surrounding you and with frightening politeness inviting you to dinner... Their leader turns out to be a very kind lady who tells you that they no longer hunt people, but rather take care of them to avoid starving to death... They have even created a small town and offer you a peaceful neighborhood. 

### Nazi

Everyone forgot about the Nazis a hundred years ago, but it turns out that all this time they have been hiding in their secret bunkers and developing new technologies. And now, after the cataclysm, they have taken advantage of the chaos and are trying to take over the world again! They are completely insane and have attacked you without even trying to figure out who you are!

### Medieval City

You find this city just where you expect it to be - by the sea. Thousands of years ago, this convenient location was home to a prosperous port, and it still thrives today. People fish and farm, skilled guards walk the streets, and adventurers hunt monsters. It even has its own king! You don't make yourself known, you just have a nice beer in the tavern and chat with the people. It seems like a pretty nice place to live.

### Matriarchy

You haven't met many people yet, but there seems to be a very harsh matriarchy thriving in the world today... Not only do women rule over families and society, they even keep some men as pets! Hell, they even put a collar on you when you decided to pretend to be a simple traveler! Uh... Well... At least they treat their pets well! You didn't even want to run away!

### Purifiers

Some survivors managed to unite in a religious cult a century ago and kept the knowledge of the past world. They fanatically fight monsters, mutants and other threats without trying to negotiate or find another solution. They just burn everything and everyone, which is why many people don't like them.

### Witch Hunt

Some pretty bizarre beliefs have emerged in the world... You saw the people catch the witch, so you were afraid they'd execute her, but... they all took turns fucking her to "exorcise" the evil spirit. Some even brought wine! After a few hours, the witch got enough and flew away, but everyone just shouted that they would catch her again in a week.

### Shortstack

At first you thought it was just a coincidence, but the more you meet people, the more obvious it becomes that all the girls in the new world are very short, but still have great breasts and asses! You're not sure what caused it, but they just look great and that size seems to be pretty damn handy!

### New Races

Many of the most unusual races and their hybrids have appeared in the world. It seems that the Cataclysm united them all, so now you can easily meet a half-breed of even elf and goblin, and no one thinks it strange anymore. Hmm... Although you have to admit, a lot of mestizos do look amazing!

### Plant Girls

You still can't figure out how some plants evolved into plant girls. They look a lot like real girls and they all have great figures.... Soft breasts, juicy holes... You thought it was some kind of trap, and it often is, but many plant girls are not aggressive at all, they only feed on light and water, and although they can't talk, they're always ready to have fun with humans.

### Tentacle Plants

Some plants don't pretend to be girls, they catch girls themselves! They are amazingly agile and nimble, and could easily hunt animals, but instead they capture humans... To feed them honey? For some reason they really dislike clothes and try to fill all holes at once... And they feed long and hard... But then they just let the person go! Something is definitely wrong here!

### Drowzee

These little critters only seem cute and harmless! They are not much smarter than wolves, but somehow they have mastered mental magic and can control people! That would be absolutely horrible, but for some reason they only use it to rape girls and erase their memories, so most people don't even know about their perversions!

### Werewolves

These guys are really dangerous, no joke. Their regeneration, strength, and endurance are unbelievable, and they are not afraid of silver at all. They can easily tear anyone to pieces, but they're too fond of domination and would never hurt a good submissive bitch, so all you have to do to save yourself is get down on all fours and don't resist.

### Generic Monsters

Some monsters look like someone was too lazy to come up with something new and just added new features to already existing beasts... You're pretty sure that normal evolution isn't capable of adding a mouse's fire breath! And hell, they even have coloring that changes with the critter's danger level! Only thing missing is a number with a level above the head!

### Mermaids

When you swim in the sea, you meet some real mermaids. They are as intelligent as humans and can even talk, so you start chatting and exchanging trinkets. According to their legends, during the cataclysm, the sea god sheltered people in the depths of the sea. Hmm... Someone created a special mutagen to escape from the land? That's pretty clever!

### Minotaur

Nature has given Minotaurs extremely strong bodies, they grow up to four meters tall, they are very aggressive and ready to fuck anyone with their huge cock. They are intelligent enough to fight with weapons and can even be hired as warriors if you supply them with booze and girls. But hey, for some reason they all wear a nose ring and when you pull on it, they become as docile as calves!

### Spiders

At first you think they are just another monster, but you soon find out that they are an amazing symbiosis. The spiders use the girls as incubators for their giant eggs, but in return they not only release humans after mating, but also protect them by eating all other dangerous predators around. Settlers even make a special effort to get spiders nearby, providing them with girls every three months.

### Mad Bots

Hell, no, screw it! There is no way this could have evolved on its own or left over from old times! There must be a GMO lab with mad scientists somewhere in the world! Or the secret base's AI went crazy and started creating monsters on its own! Hell, you can't even tell if they're trying to help people or destroy remnants of humanity. Or are they just playing Gods for fun?

### Kraken

You have found a beautiful beach with white sand and are just about to relax and enjoy the warm sea, when a giant Kraken comes ashore! Damn, those tentacles are definitely too big for anything! It's not funny at all - you had to run away in a panic! Although people later said it just wanted to give you a hug, because it's actually as friendly as a dolphin.

### Master of Shadows

You'd been traveling for over a month when one of the shadow creatures caught up with you... Or was it someone else? Either way, you couldn't escape and had to fight to the death, especially since there was only one of them. With great difficulty, you managed to kill it. But even as it was disappearing, the shadow whispered that sooner or later you would still be a part of it...

### Dragon

Deep in the northern mountains, you climbed one of the snow-capped peaks to take in the scenery and froze in animal horror at the sight of the colossal, impossibly huge figure of a dragon. Legends of these monsters exist on all worlds, but this is the first time you have seen one in person. It's unlikely that it feeds on tiny humans, but you still decided to run away and never come near these mountains again.

### Lonely Bunnies

You discover a whole village of bunny girls and they have a huge problem! They're in heat, but there are no men around because they've all run away beforehand! Well... Of course you can't leave them in trouble and help each of them! This will be one of your 13 legendary feats, no less!

### Professor Gadget

You barely recognize your old mechanics teacher when you meet him. Surprisingly, thanks to his endless gadgets, this genius has not only survived the apocalypse, but has even reconstructed his body, almost completely replacing it with artificial parts and becoming virtually immortal! You will definitely have a lot to talk about!

### Pretender

It seems that you have become quite famous... People somehow found out that you survived the apocalypse, got superpowers, slept for a hundred years, and came back like a hero from the myths. They expect miracles and feats from you, and some have even started pretending to be you to scare people with your name! Huh, you should definitely find those rascals and teach them a lesson!

### Rocket

You noticed a huge space rocket taking off into the sky. It was dozens of times larger than a war rocket, so you were not afraid that someone had launched a nuclear strike, but you still hurried to the launch site, expecting to find a city that had kept such technology. But it seems that the inhabitants of that vault were only busy building a rocket all these years, spent all their resources on it, and flew off to colonize Mars!

### Ancient Ruins

In your wanderings, you have stumbled upon a truly ancient ruin that is many thousands of years old. Surprisingly, these ruins look just like the pictures in your school textbooks, as if the apocalypse had no effect on them at all! And this is despite the fact that many modern cities have turned into a pile of rubble and rusty metal in just a hundred years! 

## How did you have fun here?



### Wild Sex

During your long lockdown in the bunker, you missed the wilderness so much that you swore you would definitely have the wildest, animal sex in the wildest places on the planet! And you're sure to fulfill that promise!

### Orgy

And you've always dreamed of... Oh, of course, you've just been missed a hot, crazy orgy! And hey, you've got plenty of money now, so you hire all the whores in town and throw the hottest party ever!

### Festival

It was so awesome that you decided to trade a few more valuable items from the bunker for tons of money to turn this orgy into an annual sex festival! Pretty soon perverts and whores from all lands will be gathering here!

### Slaves

You went to this auction just out of curiosity, but you couldn't resist buying some sex slaves... Uh-huh... You mean... You decided to rescue those pretty girls from slavery! Surely they'll love living in your cozy bunker!

### Mad Racing

Some crazy raiders in heavily tuned cars tried to catch up with you in the wasteland... It was a brutal chase, you were on full throttle and about to open fire as you... crossed the finish line? What? Hey, they even awarded you first place in the race!

### Divine

Lately you've been thinking about becoming a great ruler, and it's a great plan.... But why not call yourself a god? Or at least a saint? With all your powers, you could easily create some miracles and put on a real show for the faithful!

### Battle Angels

You'll even create real angels for yourself. Beautiful flying maidens to carry your words to the people! And punish unbelieving apostates! Mwahaha! Well, at least no one can hurt your angels if you give them machine guns!

### Demon Fight

Ugh, succubi can be really persistent... All right, fine, your temple will have worshippers fisting demons on a regular basis. It'll probably teach them all a good lesson, right? And the succubi should only have to cover their horns with illusion after a hot "exorcisms".

### Confession

The succubi are right, it's your temple and you can do whatever you want in it! As long as you perform miracles and all that, people will still believe you're a saint! So why don't you make nuns do penance with their asses, huh? After all, you didn't expect a kind of Spanish Inquisition...

### Communion

Oh yeah, of course you'll heal all your believers, they don't need to worry about STDs! And you'll make all the nuns super cute! Maybe you should make them give blowjobs for every donation? Surely the temple would benefit from such a ritual!

### Nobody Expects the Spanish Inquisition!

Those guys almost gave you a heart attack, the way they jumped out! Turns out, though, they're looking for a job in their field... Well, at least they know how to scare, so why not hire them?

### Nature Rejuvenation

You decide to spend a considerable amount of your energy and resources restoring nature around your bunker. Plant deserts with forests, feed the earth with mana, build dams to hold back the water. It won't be easy and may take months of hard work, but it will definitely make your lands much more beautiful! 

### Shrine Maiden

These yokais have become unbearable! You can handle a couple of them without any problems, but you can't do this all the time! So, you need to revive the ancient sanctuaries and shrine maidens! After all, they used to deal with these spirits somehow!

### Sexiest Dungeon

You will create the best dungeon for adventurers and perverts! Of course, there will be an entrance fee, but not only will you invite succubi, but you will even teach them a safe word!... And against those munchkins who refuse to play by the rules, you can always release a couple of wild tentacles.

### Monster Show

You'll have to work hard to prove your sinister fame in the new time if you want the monsters to still consider you as one of them. At the very least, you'll have to scare a few hundred travelers at night by putting on a real theatrical show for them with sinister laughter and glowing face paint. You should be a legend, so that everyone knows about you!

### Sleeping Beauty

Sometimes in dreams, memories of what happened to your body during your long sleep come back to you. How someone played with you like a doll... Sometimes you feel as if someone found your bunker and visited it like a brothel, sometimes it was your companion, fairies, succubi, the control module... No, no, it can't be true! It's just a fucking nightmare! You just need to take your sleeping pills and not think about it!

##  

   Enjoying your journey through the unknown, full of monsters and dangers, but still alive and vibrant world, you returned to your hometown where you've lived for so many years. Well, technically speaking, where your version of this world lived.    

   As you wandered the streets, a sense of longing and nostalgia washed over you, reminding you of one of your past lives. To your great surprise, you realized that one detail of the city remained consistent across many, many, of your lives. It seems that succubi exist in multiple worlds and they all crave the same thing... Anyway, you decided to pay homage to your favorite place, the Succubus Cafe, and couldn't believe your eyes when you saw it still standing, perfectly intact, even after all these years. 

   You cautiously entered the door, hoping for the best, but as expected, the cafe was empty. The superior enchantments placed on the building had kept it safe. The lights were still glowing, the water still running, and the dust and dirt miraculously vanished. But all the succubi had long since left. After all, without any customers, why would they still be here?

   There was a charming sign on the bar, inviting you to treat yourself to a free cup of coffee. So, you took advantage of the offer and brewed yourself a rich espresso before settling down at one of the empty tables. Lost in nostalgic reverie, your gaze fell upon the MazeShow flyer that had been there for a hundred years. You couldn't help but chuckle at the irony as you read their bold slogan, "Free shipping anywhere, any worlds!" It now seemed more like a bitter taunt than an enticing offer. Any worlds, huh?

   Feeling a mix of amusement and curiosity, you strolled over to the bar and picked up the phone, dialing the number...

- = MazeShow Shop = -

##  

<p style="color: #E73333FF;text-align: right;">Welcome to MazeShow Store! How may I serve you?</p>
   A pleasant, melodious voice greeted you as soon as you finished dialing. You almost dropped the phone and stared at it in disbelief, as if it were a stool talking to you. Hell, you only wanted to pretend you were in the past for a second and then laugh at your naivety, maybe find some whiskey and reminisce...

<p style="color: #E73333FF;text-align: right;"> Hello? Moshi-Moshi? Hola? Anon, is that you? I can feel you~</p>
   The girl on the other end became more and more insistent, while you remained dumbfoundedly silent. It seemed she mistook you for one of her friends? Or was it one of your old names? Nervously swallowing, you tried to explain the situation to her. Damn, it had been so long since you last used a phone that you had almost forgotten what it was like to communicate with someone hundreds of kilometers away... Hell, is she really in another world!?  

<p style="color: #E73333FF;text-align: right;">Hmmm... That's weird, I can usually sense them pretty well... 
Ah, never mind, you can pretend to be anyone if you want, any customer is welcome! 
Hold on a second, I'll check where you're calling from... 
Oh! Looks like your world is a little warped!</p>
   You tried to explain to her about the apocalypse that had happened, but the more details you gave her, the more confused you became. You still couldn't really figure out what kind of apocalypse happened here! And then you couldn't get to the surface, and after that, you were too busy exploring the new world to think about it. And who cared, it had happened a hundred years ago already!

<p style="color: #E73333FF;text-align: right;">Hmm... Zombie Meteorite, you say? Monster Girl Invasion? Dark Gods? 
Oh, those native legends and fairy tales...</p><p style="color: #AAAAAAAA;text-align: right;">She said incredulously away from the phone, and you could hear her typing something on the keyboard.</p><p style="color: #E73333FF;text-align: right;">Alright, if you're saying it's been a hundred years, then it's actually not that big of a deal anymore. 
Whoever caused that portal storm is probably long dead by now, right? 
And with time, the world will recover on its own... 
So what's up? 
How may I serve you, not-Anon?</p> 
   Oops... 
   Suddenly you were reluctant to tell her that you still remembered the old world... So you pretended to be one of the wastelanders that you accidentally found an ancient flyer and decided to call... Uh... To pray to the gods from the phone and ask for mercy!

##  

<p style="color: #E73333FF;text-align: right;">Oh, so today you're the hero and I'm the genie from the phone?
  Hahaha, as you say, Definitely-not-Anon!  
Gold? What, why do I need gold? 
Ah, payment... Come on, who needs gold in CYOAs?
 Have you ever been able to bribe someone like that, huh? 
Energy? 
Oh, I'd love to come to you and suck some sweet horny energy, my darling....</p>
   She sighed so passionately that even through the phone you could feel her hot breath and unquenchable lust, bringing back vague memories of her hot lips and skillful tongue. You involuntarily looked around to make sure no one could see the hard-on in your pants.

<p style="color: #E73333FF;text-align: right;">But eh, I'm at work...    </p>

## Shopping

<p style="color: #E73333FF;text-align: right;">All righty, I sense you have some Points left, so I'll help you spend them all! 
Let's see what I can offer you, my hero... </p>

### Pizza

How about some hot, fresh pizza? You must be missing it by now, huh? Oh, come on, it's really good! And it only costs a few points! Oh, well, how about a 30-pizza-a-month subscription? Just clap your hands and yell "Pizza Time!" and it'll appear right in front of you!

### Wi-Fi

Oh, I know exactly what you've been missing since the apocalypse! And we can give it to you! How about a little internet from another world? Online communication, guides, forums... Because of the anomalies, the speed isn't too fast, but you can even play online games!

### Invite

Speaking of online games... I'm not really supposed to say this, but... I guess the tech guys won't notice anyway, so I can give you an invite to their latest VR game! Looks like they've come up with some totally awesome new technology! I think it's coming out in half a year or so and it's going to be epic!

### Movie Collection

How about some of the best movies and shows from the surrounding worlds? Only the finest masterpieces, each one sure to make your heart flutter! A little more music? Oh, I know! For just a few points, I'll give you your very own collection of porn and hentai! There's even my own footage~

It even has a built-in quantum system so you don't need communication towers! Oh, sorry, you don't have anyone to call... How about a hundred of these phones?

### Multitool

Here you go, a great all-purpose tool kit for all occasions! Aside from the fact that this bracelet uses pocket space where you can stash a few cubic meters of consumables, the force field on the retractable tool can take on any shape! Not just knives and screwdrivers, but a drill, a welding laser, even a microscope!

### Babel Fish

A universal translator that helps you understand any language instantly! Just put it in your ear and you will hear only your native language, no matter who is talking to you! And by the way, this is an improved version, the previous one looked much worse and sold poorly.... Oh, and now you can even speak the new language!

### Solar Blaster

A real hero needs a weapon! You have to fight mutants in the wasteland somehow, right? Or whatever the threat is? Oh, never mind, here's a Solar Blaster! 30 shots that will blow a hole through a tank, and it recharges in just 10 minutes in the sun! The perfect post-apocalypse weapon!

### Paladin's Bubble

You definitely need armor, otherwise we'll have one less customer! Regular armor is easy to forget, and it can be pierced, so forget it! Take the best one, the Divine Shield! As long as you pray, you're completely invulnerable! We'll make all the necessary sacrifices to the god, so you'll have up to half an hour of protection per day.

### Traveler's Boots

It's sealed in a container and safe, just pull the ring and throw it at your enemy and they disappear, whoever they are! Oh, the hole itself will be gone in a minute, so don't worry.

### Pocket Home

But even heroes need a break from battles and adventures every now and then! Introducing our unique pocket-sized house! A giant, fancy palace floating in the clouds that you can enter by simply squeezing the ring! Hello? Oh, what do you mean, you already have a bunker? A floating palace is way cooler than any vault! It has a great view!  

### Portal to Base

Hey, seriously, how can a miserable shelter be better than an enchanted palace? It even has some small parks and a tiny lake! Clean air, amazing sunsets! Oh, man... All right, we'll put in a portal arch so you can always go back to your boring bunker! Happy now?

### Panacea

I can even offer you our universal cure! A true panacea that instantly heals any wound and even cures hereditary diseases! It can even restore youth! Wait, what do you mean you have already solved this problem? Damn, the panacea used to sell so well... Maybe you still want to take a couple of packs at a discount?

They can't even take their eyes off them for a minute! ...But I can get you into the Succubus School for a while! Of course, you'll mostly serve as demonstration and training material, but you'll be taught how to control Horny Energy!

### Freud

You will probably need the help of an experienced therapist in a post-apocalyptic environment. Here's my favorite! Freud himself, who can explain everything as an underlying attraction to a penis! Wise man, isn't he? Oh, he'll get rid of your phobias and teach you to accept yourself for who you are! And then he'll disappear, it's just a hallucination after all...

### Twin

Not enough time or hands? You just want to relax and let someone else do all the work for you, but you can't trust anyone else? You just need a twin! Your exact copy who has your skills and knowledge and will do everything exactly as you would do it yourself! Oh, don't worry, he won't be taking over your life, we only hired him for a short time in the other world, so he still has a lot of work to do back home.

### Searching Compass

Yes, you're right, there's no point in ordering from us what you can find in your own world... Portals are so-o expensive after all... But you can spend years searching for something on your own planet! Here, look, this search compass can help you with that! Just imagine what you're looking for and it will point you in the direction of the nearest such thing!

### Fairy

Oh, what do you mean, your world is full of them too? Damn, I was hoping to get rid of at least one of these annoying fairies... How about I pay you extra?

### Tymora Coin

Special offer! We have recently entered into a partnership with Tymora herself, the Goddess of Luck! She personally kissed this coin and blessed it with some of her power, so as long as it remains in your pocket, you will always experience extreme luck! Don't worry, her blessing works in your world as well! And each time it saves you from death's door, one of the seven clovers will vanish.

### Pocket Charger

Need to recharge your tech, but after the apocalypse, there are no power outlets around? Oh boy... You have such a great source of delicious power between your legs and you're looking for an outlet? Uh... Succubi usually don't do this, but just for you, I'll build a simple device that converts horny energy into electricity. Just a few orgasms and you can even power an electric car! 

### Dragonfly-S

Looking for a comfortable vehicle? You don't want to rely on horses, but there are no roads or gas stations around? I have something for you! The original name is too hard to pronounce, so we call it the "Dragonfly-S". This flying machine comes from a very, very distant bio-punk world, it can be powered by any organic matter and even make short trips into space! 

### Crown of Nobility

Hmmm... I think I know what you really want, my not-anon hero... Power and glory, right? Take over your own kingdom? Steal the princess and marry her? Take it all by force? I have another option for you! Just buy this exquisite crown for only 29.99 points! Once you wear it, everyone around you will treat you like a king from an ancient family, even the other rulers!

##  Mercenaries

<p style="color: #E73333FF;text-align: right;">It's dangerous to go alone! Take these mercenaries!</p>
   She said with some special enthusiasm and was silent for a second waiting for your reaction. 
Is that a quote from a movie? Do you have to say something in response?

<p style="color: #E73333FF;text-align: right;">Oh well... 
A crown and personal power alone won't give you your own kingdom! 
You'll need loyal people who will carry out your orders, who will raise weapons for you! 
And you can spend years searching for them in your own world, or just hire a few squads from us! 
Unlike ordinary cheap mercenaries, they've all signed a magical contract and 
won't be able to betray you, so you can trust them completely!</p>

### Landsknecht

Totally fearless and desperate guys. Once they've signed a contract, they'll follow any order, even if it means that they all die. Their huge swords are coated with silver and complex poisons, so it doesn't matter if they're fighting humans or monsters - they're ready to slaughter them all!

### Fire Witches

Those fire witches are real pyromaniacs! So much so that even their own magic isn't enough for them, so they carry around bloody flamethrowers! They're invulnerable to their own element, so stay away from them in battle! They'll create a wild firestorm and laugh and dance with the flames of hell!

### Ogres

Not the smartest guys, but damn tough and strong. Not many of them can really fight, but they're cheap, they're plentiful, and they're easily enraged, destroying everything around them. Oh yeah, we'll supply you with a special beer with sedative herbs so they don't go on a rampage in the barracks.

### Arachnids

Young spiders that have just embarked on the path of adventurers. They are very venturesome and restless. Depending on the breed, they can have a variety of innate talents. Strength, speed, intelligence, or even magic. Some of them grow very fast when well fed, so don't be surprised if in a couple years they're the size of a house!

### Guard

Their homeland has a great military tradition, but hasn't been at war with anyone in centuries. To keep their brave guardsmen from losing their skills and training, they willingly send them on the most dangerous missions! The highest discipline and morality are their hallmarks! Noble Officers are trained for military service from an early age to become true professionals! Of course, the pictured Major comes with a kit!

### Vulcan

A giant monster in indestructible steel armor. But even I find it hard to believe that it's not a golem or a robot... In any case, he is not even afraid of anti-tank shaped projectiles, and his huge mace can crush any wall! And by the way, don't think that he's slow and the enemy can easily dodge or run away! Ha! When needed, he can be surprisingly fast!

### Space Pirates

These guys don't ask for much for their service, but keep in mind that you'll be left without any trophies! They are damn good at brigandage, thieving, marauding and quick escapes! So you can just send them behind enemy lines and forget about them - they'll find something to burn and steal on their own! Supplies? What are you talking about? I'm telling you, they'll find something for themselves!  

### Hydralisks

Huh? Well, yeah, it's part of the Swarm. Destroyers of worlds, space plague, all that... Actually, the Swarm gives them to us almost for free, because they want to explore new planets... But don't worry - there's no queen among them, so they can't reproduce and take over your world! And you can just send them all on a suicide mission if you're so worried. The Swarm doesn't care about such small losses, so you don't have to worry about them either.

### PainDealers

Cannon fodder with tits! My favorite! Oh, don't worry, they won't be offended! In fact, they're all sick bitches. Sadists, masochists, exhibitionists, psychopaths... The thing is, they're immortal because of their faithful service to their bloody god, and... I think they've gone a little crazy. There's no fetish they don't enjoy, but they especially like anything that involves blood and pain. Maybe they're not the best at war, and their enemies often cut them to pieces while they squirm in pain... But hey, they're immortal, so they can still handle anyone. Oh, and feel free to play with them yourself, or they might get bored!

### Creator

Agnus the Third, one of the greatest magicians of his world! He is so powerful and loves to create so much that one world is not enough for him, and he has gladly agreed to serve as a creator on other worlds. He loves to create beautiful, exquisite palaces and entire cities, and his power is enough to transform an entire mountain range in a few weeks, so with his help you can easily build the kingdom of your dreams! War? Oh no, he hates war, so don't even offer him to fight, the contract allows him to just leave your world in that case.

### Werewolfs

Honestly, even I don't know if they're some kind of elite warrior clan or if they're actual werewolves... Well, you know, they never show their faces, and they are superhumanly strong and agile. They keep fighting even when they are badly wounded, and they recover extremely quickly. And they eat only bloody meat... They will follow any order, even the cruelest, without debate or argument. And hell, a pack of skilled werewolves in heavy armor with powerful machine guns can do a lot of things!

### Advisor

Oh, her name is best left out unless you want her to hear you... So it's best to just call her Advisor. She... She's a very ancient being. People say that she helped some of the old gods create their worlds... But of course, that's just a rumor, haha! Probably... Anyway, she's obsessed with helping people, especially rulers, get out of the most difficult situations. It's like her favorite puzzle! And the worse your situation is, the more happy she'll be to advise you! Some of her advice may seem very cruel, strange and incomprehensible, but she will not explain anything, and you will only have to trust her. 

### Death Bots

These are great fighting robots! I don't know why they have skulls instead of heads, though.... And what kind of technology they use in their weapons... Ah, never mind, we just happened to find a huge warehouse full of these ancient robots! So take it and use it, there's billions more! Oh yeah, actually they will attack anything living, so just drop a container with them into the enemy army and let them fight there themselves.

### Bodyguard Djinns

They are masters of melee and magic, and are virtually invulnerable to normal weapons, so shooting them won't work either. They will not follow your orders, fight for you, or serve you in any way other than protecting your life. But unlike other mercenaries, they're so self-confident that they always magically tie their lives to the lives of their clients, so if you die, they die. And, you know, they've been in the security business for thousands of years, and they're still alive... 

### One-Man Army

Have you ever wondered what would happen if you got your character to level 120 in a game where the maximum level is 80? Well, meet Gars. A one-man army. The greatest swordsman who can slay a demon or even a mech, a wizard who can destroy entire cities with meteor showers, a scout who can sneak under an enemy general's blanket.... Hell, he's like a manga protagonist! Keep him out of your harem!

### Battle Bitches

Our Battle Bitches! Don't think this is just an advertisement, but they are the best mercenaries you can find! We spent years and trillions designing their suits! We've gathered the best technology! We combined magic and science! We gathered the best nymphomaniacs! And, hey, I trained them myself to enjoy every second of it, to infuse their battle suits with horny energy! You can fuck them yourself later to convince yourself of their professionalism and the softness of their pussies!

## 

<p style="color: #E73333FF;text-align: right;"> Hmm? Anything else? 
Special services? Entertainment and escort?
Oh, sorry... 
We used to do that, but, you know, even MazeShow couldn't compete with my sisters! 
I mean, how can you ever hope to compete with enthusiastic free whores 
who've trained for centuries to please men with their bodies and magic? 
With hotties whose bodies are literally made for pleasure? 
Whose pussies are perfectly adaptable to any cock, 
whose juices are the best aphrodisiac?  
. . . . .
So it was really tricky, but I did everything I could to
 shut down the damn project so it wouldn't keep us from seducing guys! 
Just summon a succubus! 
Eh... Well... I mean... 
I've optimized the company's budget! 
Hahaha. 

What? Evacuate you? Vacation on another world? 
No, no, I can't! Don't even ask me! CYOA about the Resort hasn't been written yet! Ehhh... 
There's so much interference on your world from the Portal Storm, it's too dangerous! 
What about the mercenaries? 
Uh, I mean... I mean... 
There's a lot of static! Ssssh!
I can't hear you, Anon!
 SHHHH! 
Click!</p><p style="color: #AAAAAAAA;text-align: right;">The girl started hissing into the phone 
and rustling some wrapper in front of the microphone, 
and then she suddenly hung up.</p>
   It was weird, but anyway, you already ordered what you wanted. And about the vacation... Huh, you have the whole world at your disposal, surely you'll find somewhere to relax! Besides, you have so many things to do and plans to make! 

   Perhaps now it really is time to get your own kingdom! With these mercenaries, you'll be able to conquer anyone!

## Chapter 10

- = Conquest = -

## Seize your kingdom!

   Drawing on the memories of the past world, you prepared yourself for brutal and bloody battles, believing that you have to fight for every inch of land for your kingdom...
 
   But...
 
   Actually, no one claims the ruins around your shelter... Hell, there is practically no one here at all! And going somewhere far away to capture cities doesn't make any sense. After all, you will not be able to defend your capital if it is located away from your bunker, and running back and forth would quickly become tiresome. So, with a great sense of relief and underlying frustration, you just ride around killing monsters and putting up signs saying that this land now belongs to you and you will be happy to welcome new settlers.
 
   Realizing that ruling without subjects would be quite boring, you generously offer the best conditions in this post-apocalyptic wasteland for as many people as possible to move to your land. Protection from monsters, new free houses, hot water, electricity, first-class health care! The city you build will be advanced even by the standards of the past world, and many refugees can't believe in such a miracle, that someone is willing to let them into this paradise.
 
   But you need tens, hundreds of thousands of people, so you are happy to accept anyone as long as they follow the basic laws. Farmers, hunters, builders, merchants, artists, and whores... You even organize several schools to train craftsmen for new industries and factories.
 
   Not everything goes exactly as you want, but soon your capital becomes one of the most famous and prosperous cities in the region, and people proudly call you their king.

## Chapter 11

- = Science = -

## 

   The few months you spend traveling the world fill you with enthusiasm and a passion to create! You finally feel neither loneliness nor despair, and what's more - you are able not only to learn the traditions and sciences of this world, but also to finally organize the rambling, scattered memories in your head. Your many versions in different dimensions practice not only science, but magic, precision mechanics, electronics, and even the occult! This incredible, extraordinary fusion of knowledge from different realms floods your mind with countless bold and original ideas. After all, you have the unique opportunity to combine the best of all these worlds!

   But hell, running your new city takes up all your time! You automate a lot of things, but you still have to meet with people every day to give orders and check on things, when all you dream of doing is hiding in your labs and working on your inventions! You even begin to regret becoming King, but after a few months the hustle and bustle dies down and you can finally get back to your favorite work.

### MagicByte

Maybe these computers look silly with their tiny screens, limited memory, and weak processors... But on the bright side, your invention doesn't require complex factories and machines! All the mechanical components can be made by ordinary craftsmen using hammers and files, while the processors and some of the electronics are replaced by magic crystals! You can start mass production right away!

### Soul Catcher 

Traditional AI and automatic systems for droids require extremely complex technology and programming, but through some dark rituals of the Necromancers, you were able to... Oh, no, you didn't resort to forcibly extracting human souls from their bodies! For now, you only work with animals, but even their souls allow you to create amazingly intelligent automatons! 

### Mana Converter

It wasn't as easy as you thought, and it took weeks of painstaking research and insanely complex mathematical calculations, but you've managed to create a generator that converts mana into electricity with the highest efficiency! More importantly, it can also convert regular electricity into pure mana, so you don't have to wait for magical items to absorb mana from the air on their own!

### Book Recharger

Usually, mages have to meditate for hours to replenish their magical grimoire with mana, and scribes make their spell scrolls disposable because of the extremely complex ritual to infuse them with energy... But you have solved this problem! Your charging station allows them to be recharged in just a minute! Well... However, the most powerful scrolls usually burn up during the casting of the spell...

### Machine Care

You've heard many legends about the Spirit of the Machine, and you've even seen a few times yourself how a malfunctioning machine continued to serve to save its owner. But only now have you been able to understand this phenomenon! Well, okay, you couldn't figure out how it works... But you've created gloves that multiply that care tenfold! All you have to do is pet the car and it will serve you more eagerly. 

### Magitanks

It's even surprising why artifactors in magical worlds focus on creating humanoid golems. They are much harder to create, right? And you can't put a powerful cannon on them... So you decided to use all the wonders of magic to create superior, light, and fast armored vehicles! They consume an unimaginable amount of mana, but the charge lasts for a week, and that's more than enough for victory! 

### Lens Focus

Maybe this is not your best invention... And surely someone else has thought of it before, but... After all, you don't make these lenses by hand, you make them on a machine, so if they break, it's not that scary!  It's not like they're high-grade crystal that costs more than gold, they're just tempered glass! And they allow you to focus most spells by increasing their range or damage by orders of magnitude!

### Raw Mana

In fact, humans are unable to control raw mana, and are always limited to spells, elements, and individual forms of magic... But with your invention, humans will finally be able to effectively control and sense raw magic! This practically opens up a new school of powerful magic that will allow you to control the very streams of mana around you! You will even be able to simply steal your opponent's mana replenishment!

### Rapid Summon

It was an unexpected discovery, but it turns out that the pentagram doesn't actually have to be drawn with blood.... The shape and the sacrifice are important, but they don't have to be used together! For accelerated summoning of small demons and spirits you can actually use a hologram of the pentagram and an ampule with pre-prepared ritual blood! Now you can summon an imp in less than a second!

### External Source

Perhaps this is one of your greatest inventions after the portal system! An external source of mana with a complex system of focusing crystals in gloves will allow anyone to feel like a real battle mage! They don't even need to learn spells anymore - the system itself will create a fireball, lightning bolt, or any other built-in spell! And even experienced mages can use it to save their mana reserves!

## Chapter 12

- = Strange Signal = -

##  

   You were on the verge of another great discovery when you got distracted from your research by an encrypted emergency signal from your own base on another continent. Annoyed by this ridiculous nuisance, you of course think it's a mistake! But no matter how many times you check the sensor readings, it seems that your base is indeed there and has been attacked.

   You think about it for only a few hours before you decide to investigate the situation yourself, even though you are not sure what to expect. It can't possibly be a trap - after all, the signal is top secret and has never been used before, making it impossible for anyone to replicate it. But... After all, your bunker is perfectly fine, and you can see it with your own eyes... Anyway, it's a mystery worth exploring and maybe saving... uh, someone?

   Arriving at the location, you are shocked and horrified to see... Your own bunker in the middle of the wasteland, practically destroyed by someone! You cautiously check the surroundings, but there is no one here. The smoke from the bunker ruins is the only thing moving in this lifeless dead land, so you dare to get closer. The wretched remnants of the security system recognize you as the owner and immediately inform you that there is no one inside and that the damaged reactor is about to explode, so it is also recommended that you evacuate at least a few dozen miles away for your safety.

   Looks like you arrived at the last moment and have less than an hour to deal with this mysterious copy of your bunker. 

   <b><span style="color: #c07072;">You only have time for only one action</span></b>. What will you do? 

## 



### Trace the Double

If this is a replica of your bunker from another world... Then there must be your own double! You must find him, or at least traces of him, to find out what happened to him!

### Looting

You have no idea where this bunker came from or where your double went, but it's full of unique equipment and technology that you'll need! You still have time to save something from here!

### Revenge

Your world is just starting to recover from the apocalypse, and you don't want an exploding reactor here! So you decide to set up the portal system for one last jump, sending the bunker to the exact place where it was attacked to get revenge on the offenders of your double.

### Save the Bunker

Hell, your double just wanted to escape and didn't even think about saving your base! There's so little time left... It's going to be damn dangerous, but you can still take your chances and try to stabilize the reactor!

### Escape

Surely your double wasn't that stupid, and if he thought this base was doomed, then it is! And that means that you don't need to take any risks, but better to be prudent and evacuate now, as the control module says!

##

## 



### 

No matter how many times you look for your double, he seems to have vanished into thin air! You have searched the entire bunker, but have found neither him nor his body, although there are suspicious traces of blood in places. There was no sign of him in the wasteland either, although there must have been footprints or vehicles in the sand. Unfortunately, the security system couldn't clear anything up either, it just said that you had already successfully evacuated and it would be a mistake to come back. In the end, you had no choice but to follow his insistence to save your life, for your skills were not enough for the search.

### 

Fortunately, your skills and abilities were enough to deal with the mysterious disappearance of your double! Of course, he didn't vanish into thin air or run off into the desert in a panic! Ha! This trickster not only tried to confuse possible pursuers with a series of chaotic teleportations through different worlds, but also escaped somewhere along the way! Surely he, like you, had a backup plan and an emergency kit, so he could now be anywhere on any of the dozens of worlds this bunker teleported through! It's a shame you never met him, but now it's time for you to run, so you don't get blown up along with this bunker! Ugh... And damn it, you're going to have to get ready to meet whoever might be chasing him!

### 

After the brutal attack, there weren't many undamaged rooms and equipment left. However, the bunker was still full of unique items from other worlds, so you started looting valuable items and equipment as fast as you could. Oh, you even found a replica of your favorite slippers, which you accidentally burned with acid during your experiments last year! Experiments! Hell, of course you have to rescue all the results of your double's research, surely there must be something fantastic in there!

### 

Damn, your double ran away and sent this base to your world to explode! Luckily, it appeared in the desert, but damn it, your world isn't a garbage dump, and you definitely don't need the consequences of an explosion from an unknown reactor here! What if it's radioactive or causes some other catastrophe? As you set up the portal system for the last jump, you suddenly realized where you should send this emergency bunker. Back, of course! You have no idea who your double was fighting with and who almost destroyed this bunker. But one thing's for sure - whoever it was, they're your enemy, simply because they'll attack you as soon as they see you! So you definitely won't feel sorry for them! This bunker served its previous owner well, saving his life, and now it will serve as a tool for revenge!

### 

Damn it, you only have a few hours before the damaged reactor explodes, and you don't even know what technology it was built with! It sounds like sheer madness, but you still decided to try and save this base! The fact that your duplicate escaped doesn't mean anything - maybe he was injured or panicked! But you can't just let this unique base, full of equipment from different worlds, explode!

Unfortunately, your skills were not enough for such a difficult task. And when you realized that, there was no time to escape.

Fuck...

You had only a few minutes left before the explosion that would destroy everything for a dozen miles around, you were in the middle of a half destroyed and full of debris bunker.... Is your story going to end so stupidly?

### 

Damn it, you only have a few hours before the damaged reactor explodes, and you don't even know what technology it was built with! It sounds like sheer madness, but you still decided to try and save this base! The fact that your duplicate escaped doesn't mean anything - maybe he was injured or panicked! But you can't just let this unique base, full of equipment from different worlds, explode!

### 

 After retreating to a safe distance, you and your men took refuge among the rocks. A short tense wait as you mentally counted down the last minutes....

EXPLOOOOSION!!!

Damn, you were almost deafened by that monstrous blast! The ground beneath your feet shook for a few more minutes as the rocks slowly fell from the sky. Eh, it was a great base... Too bad you didn't find out what happened there. Who attacked this base? Where did your double go? What world did he come from? But at least you and all your people are safe, and that's all that matters! 

## 



### 

After finishing your stuff, you barely escaped the base at the last moment. You're not sure what principle the local reactor was based on, but the bright blue flash that split the sky behind you was so bright that even its reflection blinded you, and the monstrous shock wave that caught up with you a few seconds later knocked you to the ground.

Later, you tried to find something in the huge crater left at the site of this mysterious base, but all you found was molten metal and rocks. Well, at least that explosion didn't leave any radiation behind...

### 

 When you finished setting it up, you ran away just in case, not sure if the damaged system could handle the teleport. And you'd never seen a bunker transfer from the outside, so you didn't really know what to expect.... As it turned out, it wasn't that bad! A silent black flash distorted everything around you, and a second later the abandoned bunker was replaced by a huge crater in the ground. Interestingly, where had all the earth gone? Well, you'll have plenty of time to analyze the consequences of this unexpected experiment...

### 

You did try to escape, but you didn't stand a chance. The flare incinerated you in less than a second, by ending your life.

### Escape Master

Huh! A challenge just for you! It's for moments like this that you've trained so much to escape from the most impossible situations! 

### Emergency Portal

Ugh... You didn't want to use that so badly... Hell, you still don't want to now, but it looks like you have no choice! I'd rather have a week of tentacles having fun with you than have you explode in here!

### Portal Gun

Sounds horrible, but only if you don't have a portal gun with you! Just a few quick jumps and you were a dozen kilometers away from the explosion!

### Spectral Shift

To be honest, you get nervous every time you use this ability, but it seems like you have no other choice. Spectral Shift took you partially out of this world and you could see the full power of the explosion while standing right in the center of it.

### Portals

Geez, you honestly thought you could save this base...

Ahhh... 

Okay, it's time to open the portal and go home!

### Paladin's Bubble

You kneeled down and habitually began to recite the prayer that had been sent to you from the MazeShow Store. You're not used to this invulnerability yet, so just to be safe, you've got your eyes closed, so that nothing could distract you from the saving prayer!

### Pocket Home

Hell, you're not sure if that's going to save you, but it looks like you have no other options left, so you activate the Pocket Home you just bought! In a flash, you're in your luxurious palace, safe and sound. The only question is whether you can get back...

### Traveler's Boots

Well, now it's definitely time to run! In your brand new Traveler's Boots you didn't even pay attention to the debris, and as soon as you were outside you started jumping several hundred meters per step. Huh, turns out you had a whole minute to wait!

### Tymora Coin

You were desperate because you couldn't think of anything that could save your life. You could only hope for a miracle! Out of desperation and anger you kicked the reactor, a few sparks ran through it, some tube fell off the side, steam came out and...? the reaction stopped? Was that really all you had to do!?

Disbelieving your luck, you decided to pray to Timora just in case, took out her lucky coin, and noticed that one of the seven clovers had disappeared.

### Bodyguard Djinns

In panic you started pulling all the levers and pressing all the buttons, hoping to fix everything somehow at the last minute, but a skillful blow to the back of your head stopped your panic. The Bodyguard Djinns that had been standing quietly behind you all this time decided that it was time to act, stunned you, picked you up and whirled away, silently swearing at the stupid employer.

### Creator

As soon as it became obvious that you couldn't manage, Agnus just waved his hand and the reactor that was about to explode turned into an exquisite azure statue of mysterious material. It looked so stunning that even the legendary Creator himself marveled at its appearance, calling it one of his finest works.

### Umighok Broadarm

When you finally gave up, Umighok Broadarm, who had already managed to find some booze in the bunker and get pretty drunk, came forward. Oh, of course he couldn't help it, he's a blacksmith, not a nuclear physicist! Anyway, it doesn't matter, so you let him do what he wants... You couldn't even think for a second that the dwarf would grin wryly as usual and start forging a glowing reactor with his heavy hammer. Damn, that's just impossible! How could he even fix a goddamn reactor with forging without knowing how it works?!

### Len Sabino

You were about to give up when you were backed up by the resilient Len. Oh, well, actually she was about to run away, but she had a really brilliant idea, so she came back to fix everything!

### Enginseer Octavian "Cv-36"

You were still going to try to escape somehow, but Octavian wasn't even thinking of giving up. Leaving a base like this? That kind of technology!? That's sacrilege! Deciding to resort to last resort he ripped a bundle of wires from his neck and connected to the reactor directly by hugging it. It looked crazy, but gradually the reactor began to cool down until it shut down completely.

### Rachel "Wraith" Hurley

While you were pounding the keyboard in frustration Rachel burst into the room. As usual, she was disheveled and had already stolen a whole bunch of stuff from the base. But as soon as she noticed the glowing, overflowing reactor, her eyes lit up with an otherworldly light and she dropped her loot to the floor. With an incredible howl, she leapt like a wildcat across the room and bit into the damn reactor with her teeth! That girl had gone completely insane!

Or... 

You couldn't believe it, she gnawed through the reactor casing like it was cardboard! Right before your eyes, she opened her jaws impossibly wide and gnawed into the glowing core, which was immediately covered in frost as Wraith sucked all the energy out of it! A second later, the girl lost consciousness and fell into your arms. Damn it, who the fuck is she?!

### Tech Savvy

Thanks to your unparalleled sense of engineering, you managed to figure out this unfamiliar device in just a dozen minutes. You didn't have time to fix it, so you just shut it down safely. Strange, your double must have known this reactor much better than you... Why did he decide to sacrifice the bunker and escape?

### Hight IQ

You were always a smart guy. And now, instead of running around the reactor like a madman with a bunch of tools in your hands trying to fix it, you decided to look for an emergency shutdown system. There's no way a reactor this advanced wouldn't have one! Hell, even if it didn't, you'd probably install it yourself! Which means your double would have, too! 

Heh, it was right where you would have put it, but someone broke out the control panel and threw it aside... That's weird... Anyway, all you had to do to start the emergency procedure was short-circuit a few wires, and the reactor started to cool down. 

### Hacking

The base control module kept repeating like clockwork that the base is doomed and you need to evacuate... This immediately alarmed you, why is it just repeating the same thing over and over again instead of helping you save the bunker? Instead of repairing the reactor, you preferred to spend your time breaking some elementary programs that your double obviously wrote in a big hurry. As soon as you removed the block from the control module, the repair bots showed up and shut down the reactor in a few minutes. 

### Engineering

Your technical knowledge helped you quickly realize that you can't fix the reactor that easily, you need more time! But hey, it's just overheating! All you need to do now is cool it down - and you can do that easily! A little pipe, a pump, and water pours down on it, evaporating and taking the heat away! A bit barbaric, but the main thing is that now you have time to think of something better! 

### Sapper

An overheated reactor is basically a giant bomb, right? And you know a lot about bombs! Armed with your trusty wire cutters and screwdrivers, you quickly removed the casing and began cutting the reactor from the periphery.... Hmm... As you thought, it was only a matter of removing all external signal sources and the advanced reactor autonomously activated the safety protocol and began to cool down. Maybe all the explosions and destruction damaged the control module and it drew too much power or something? 

### Hackers Hands

Dressed in your advanced hacker suit, you immediately launched some techno-tentacles inside the reactor and were able to override the controls at the most basic level. Something from the outside kept demanding increased power production and blocking the built-in defenses, but you easily interrupted the signal and the reactor automatically shut down. When you traced the source of the suspicious signal, you found a simple circuit board, surely created by your double. It looks like he was forced to leave the bunker, but didn't want anyone else to have it, so he decided to blow it up. 

### Pause

Damn, so little time and so much pressure - no time to think things through! 

Oh, right! You could just press pause!

By activating your special ability, you accelerate your thinking a million times and thought about everything you had learned while your body and the world froze. After a few hours of quiet reflection, you drew up a mental blueprint for such a reactor, then cancelled the pause and quickly fixed the fault that was causing it to overheat.

## 



### 

Oh... seem like you're dead? Uh... You were too greedy and you paid for it... 

But that's okay! 

There's still time for you to return to your base in ghost form and use the spare body!

### 

Oh... seem like you're dead? Uh... You were too greedy and you paid for it... 

But that's okay! 

That's why you decided to give up your body and control only droids! What does it matter if one of them is destroyed? You just need to activate the other one!

### 

Oh... seem like you're dead? Uh... You were too greedy and you paid for it... 

Strange, why can you still think? 

Oh, that's right... It's Phylactery that's already started resurrecting you! Looks like you lost part of your soul in that explosion, but you're still alive! Hmm... Will the soul regenerate over time?

That's why you decided to give up your body and control only droids! What does it matter if one of them is destroyed? You just need to activate the other one!

### 



### 

You wiped the sweat from your forehead and leaned back in your favorite chair, which in this version of the bunker had been damaged by shrapnel, but was still damn comfortable. Ha! You made it after all! It almost cost you your life, but you managed to stop the reactor from exploding! You saved this base! And now that the control module has recognized you as the Master, you can consider it yours with a clear heart, especially since your double is unlikely to return here without a portal system.

Despite the extensive damage and destruction caused by the someone's attack, hey, it still has a reactor, a control module and a portal system, and that's the most important thing! You can fix the rest, right? The rest can be fixed, right? Now you have the perfect outpost on another continent, which will come in handy sooner or later!

In the meantime, it's worth finding out why your double left this base and decided to run away to some worlds during the chaotic teleports...

It took you several days to uncover the truth that gripped your heart with icy terror. You had been prepared for anything but this! Even if he had gone up against the gods themselves, it would have been easier to accept. Damn it, this base had been attacked by another one of your doubles!

### Powerful Emitter

You were able to refine the psi emitter you found and succeeded in increasing its effective radius by almost 100 miles! Now you control even more land!

### Powerful Emitter

It took a lot of work to develop a more powerful antenna, but you still managed to increase the effective radius of the psi emitter by almost 100 miles! Now you control even more land!

### Portable Repeater

A stationary emitter is great, but what if you decide to go on a new adventure? Would you have to give up all that fun? No way! You'd rather build a portable device that repeats the signal for five miles around you!

### Portable Repeater

A stationary emitter is great, but what if you decide to go on a new adventure? Would you have to give up all that fun? No way! You'd rather build a portable device that repeats the signal for five miles around you!

### Sandman

Sleeping girls will never wake up no matter how much fun you have with their bodies. Just leave no trace, wipe up after yourself and all that, and they won't suspect a thing!

### Switchable Normalize

You decided to make a small pocket control device so that you could still turn off some of the settings. After all, sexy fun is great, but sometimes it's worth remembering normal life for a change!

### Beautification

This device works even better than you thought it would! In time, it will make all people more beautiful, so that everyone will be at least an 8 out of 10!

### Hentai Logic

The girls' sexual sensitivity is greatly increased, so that after a minute of hardcore sex, their inhibitions fall away and they start enjoying dicks regardless of the circumstances.

### Hentai Physics

It will require extra energy, but now inside that field, all the holes become so elastic that they can take almost anything, and sex never leaves any negative consequences.

### Through Clothes

Ha, you can even make clothes super stretchy, so now you can stick a dick up someone's ass without even taking their pants off!

### Right Size

You can amplify that twisting field so much that you can forget about anatomy altogether! Now you can put anything in any hole, as long as it's smaller than their torso!

### Bouncing

When you start fucking a girl, she will join in and keep the rhythm you set. Even if it's rape, she'll bounce on your dick without seeing anything strange in it. It doesn't mean she likes it, it's just a reflex!

### Accelerated Pregnancy

To make your subjects breed faster, you can make it so that the more aroused a girl is, the faster her pregnancy goes! The theoretical limit is just over a week!

### Child Friendly

Children are your future, so it is unacceptable to let monsters scare them! Now they won't even think of attacking them until kids grow up a bit!

### Naked Training

The hotter a girl is and the more people stare at her, the more effective her workout becomes. Up to 500% workout efficiency when someone whacks off looking at her!

### Saintess

You don't have time to do church stuff all the time, so you'll let any really cute girl become a Saintess to entertain the faithful!

### Miracles

It won't be easy, but to make people really believe, you'll even make it so that she can transform into angelic form and perform small miracles!

### Naked King

When you take off your clothes, it makes others feel so uncomfortable in their clothes that they immediately take off their clothes too.

### Prized Seat

Once you're in a public place with a naked boner, all the pretty girls will be able to think about is how to get on your dick as fast as possible. They might even try to do it right here!

### Neutral Judge

Girls will ask you if a certain outfit looks good on them and will accept your opinion, even if they thought the opposite or everyone around them is trying to change their mind.

### Approval

Everyone will care about your approval. Your headpats are really amazing, and everyone enjoys them and wants to earn them over and over again. Even if they say they don't, baka!

### Perfect Match

Your hands look so harmonious on a naked female body that they sometimes ask you to put your hand on their boobs to take a photo or just for beauty's sake!

### Slap

A spanking on the buttocks will both excite and embarrass the girls, but they'll just smile knowing it's just a courtesy, a local tradition! Wait, does it even work, or is everyone just accepts your weirdness?

### Harassment

You can even go down their panties and stick a few fingers in a tender hole or hold something sweet. But not for more than a minute, otherwise it's already harassment!

### Right of the First Night

Every girl will think that her virginity should only be taken by the ruler and will look forward to the day when you invite her to your bunker for a hot night!

### Come On, Use It, Man

Everyone around you agrees that you should have lots of sex. People will even offer you their daughters, and hotties who are just passing by will offer you their holes if they feel you haven't had sex in a week.

### Pets

People will become much more accepting of human pets, and it will now be common to see someone walking their lusty girlfriend on a leash. As long as they are collared and leashed, they are free to act like bitches!

### Cum Mask

Girls will be very proud of your cum on their face and will enjoy the sensation for as long as possible and take pictures as a keepsake. They will even feel sorry for it when it dries up.

### Reward

Your cum on her face is the ultimate reward, many girls will do anything to earn it. Everyone around will praise the lucky girl and not let her wash it off, saying it is rude and even sacrilegious.

### Priceless Moment

Her cognition clears up for a minute when you cum. It's really fun to reward a girl in front of her friends and family while she's in a complete stupor from everyone thanking you and not letting her fight back. 

### Priorities

Partners always put your pleasure before their own. From their point of view, when you make them cum, it is just an additional pleasant reward, not something mandatory. It is more important for them to make sure you cum and enjoy it.

### Shared Orgasm

They will experience your orgasm tenfold, and they will enjoy it so much more than their own that they will completely stop caring about their pleasure and start to see their body only as a tool for you to cum and share that magical orgasm with them.

### Best Seat

Facesitting will become super popular and as natural as a friendly hug! Only a lot more pleasant! As soon as someone lies down, the girls themselves will offer their butts wanting to sit on their face!

### Training

All girls will take sex very seriously. They have to do their best! They will often practice difficult positions, increase their endurance, and even work out with their girlfriends. Kegel exercises are now the most important part of the morning warm-up!

### Coach

All girls will agree that you have every right to give them any sexual training you want, as long as they are able to perform it. Two hours of deep throating with a sex machine? Damn, that's really exhausting... But if you say so...

### Fresh Lube

Any hottie will always be happy to give you her pussy juice as a lubricant when you're fucking someone else in the ass or whatever. So just ask any chick and she won't turn you down.

### Girls Duty

You can ask any girl to take your cum on her face, breasts or ass. They don't have to enjoy it or lick it off, but they will just think that men should only cum on girls and nowhere else. It's just natural and right!

### Some Holes

They all think that breasts are good, but guys should cum inside... You have to put your dick somewhere to shoot off, right? So their ass and mouth are all yours! Of course, they won't spit out the cum, that's rude!

### Right Hole

A girl's pussy is literally made by the gods or nature to receive dicks and cum! It's an obvious fact! How can they go against the will of the gods themselves? Just say the word and they'll bend over for you!

### Only Here

They'll even really insist on it. After all, it's wrong to just cum on a napkin or anywhere else! It's sacrilege! It's a sin! That's what girls are for! If there are enough girls around, they will even try to take turns watching you to prevent such sacrilege!

### Casino

All casinos accept sexy bets. Just sex or blowjobs aren't worth much here, but virginity or hardcore stuff is so highly valued that many girls think it's a great idea to play for "free". That way they can win big even without money! Well... Or find themselves in sexual slavery for a few days...

### Bimbo Flu

When it's nice and sunny outside, girls sometimes seem to get a special "flu". They don't cough, but they get temporarily dumber, dress like whores, giggle silly, and completely ignore being groped. And of course, they become extremely easy to get drunk and fuck!

### Exhibitionist

There will be a lot more exhibitionist chicks and they will be a lot bolder! Anyone who notices them can punish them by spanking their ass, or even fuck them if they are very bad girls and have cheekily written "Free Use" on their ass!

### Best Way

Girls will not only try to thrust their throats onto your cock as hard as they can, they will even ask you or someone else to guide their head with hands, using it like a cheap ona-hole! After all, it's so much more enjoyable that way!

### Clear Hints

When it comes to sex and perversion the whole female innuendo is suddenly pretty damn obvious. They won't even expect a guy to understand anything more complicated than "FUCK MY ASS NOW!" anymore.

### Activities

There will be many particularly perverse competitions and activities among the citizens of your capital. Many will be very embarrassed by them, but no one will refuse, believing that it is an old tradition of the nation and should be respected. Popping a balloon with her ass on a guy's groin? Oh... okay!

### Promoting

Girls of different physiques will always compete with each other for male attention, proving that their figure is the desired ideal. They will often organize various parades and live demonstrations showing themselves in all their glory. They might even have a huge boobs party or something!

### Apologies

No one will feel that they have apologized in true sincerity until they strip naked and fall to their knees. People may even begin to believe that any clothing hides the insincerity and deception of the apology.  Of course they will be ashamed, but that's the point, isn't it?

### Trial

All citizens are assured that anal on the first date is not something reprehensible or weird. It's not pussy, right? That means it's just a free test of a girl's body, her warmth and tenderness! Of course, the guy will only appreciate her more after that!

### My Ahegao Face

Chicks will be very proud of their ahegao and will often show it to all comers to show them the peak of their pleasure, their ecstasy. They will even hang their portraits on the walls, capturing the moments of their orgasm, because it is in this moment that their face is the most beautiful!

### Lover Day

Once a year there is a nationwide celebration where girls confess their beloved and find new lovers. It is considered a shame to be without a date, without someone to fuck them at night, so they will make more invitations just in case!

### Last Drop

Spilling a drop of cum is more embarrassing than peeing in public! So the girls would rather take the cock deeper and be held tightly to be sure that even if they accidentally choke, they will not lose even a drop!

### Top-Class

Being a whore would become a very honorable and dignified title. Almost like a local star! Girls will dream about it and will gratefully accept any dirty compliment. And of course, they will be happy if someone invites them to a party as a slut!

### Fashion Accessory

Bullet vibrators with remote on a cute pink leash will be an insanely popular accessory for girls. No fashionista will go out without at least a few of these! And preferably a dozen of them at once, so that everyone around can hear a light buzzing inside her!

### Anal Flower

You have discovered an amazing plant and decided that every girl should wear it! After all, it is not only cute, but also a useful symbiont that helps to absorb all food without leaving any waste! It also makes the anal area extra sensitive due to constant stimulation!

### Autoconsent

Girls no longer realize that a sexual proposition can be refused. Even if they are not in the mood, they cannot say no or run away. They may try to postpone the rape or suggest something else, but they can't even explain to themselves how it's possible to say no, because it's sex!  

### Celebrations

No important event, meeting or celebration is left without a worthy orgy! Not to invite at least a few dozen whores is like leaving the tables at a buffet empty and without alcohol! Even sober puritans would criticize such rudeness! 

##  

   Undoubtedly, your psi-emitter is a magnificent invention and now life in your kingdom will become much more exciting, especially for you, but... Actually, the problem with crime hasn't gone anywhere...

   Aah! Screw it! It seems like this post-apocalyptic world only understands brute force! So you simply need to create more combat drones to maintain order! It doesn't matter if it's humans or monsters, they will obey your laws! 

### Fun Only

There are too few people left in the world, they are too valuable to be killed! Especially women, future mothers who will give birth to offspring! That's why you've issued a special decree forbidding the killing of beauties, even if they started the fight! Oh, of course, the victor can bang girls, but only after tending to their wounds, otherwise they will be punished by the heavens! Your battle drones won't miss a beat!

### Torn Clothes

Damn, the wounds... Fighting until the girl is completely exhausted is too cruel! That's why you have decided to ban bloody fights! From now on, a girl is considered defeated when most of her clothes are torn! Once her pants, panties, and bra are torn, she must surrender to the mercy of the victor! After all, it is obvious that if the opponent is stronger, there is no need to shed blood and fight for nothing.

### Restraints

Geez, why do people always try to put prisoners in heavy, uncomfortable chains? Or tie the ropes on their hands too tightly, which makes the girls suffer in vain.... Of course, you forbid such cruel treatment of captives! From now on, they can only be bound with first class and most comfortable BDSM equipment! You will even produce special sets and sell them in stores! All for the comfort of the victims!

### Fair Play

To prevent the girls from complaining and becoming too afraid of fighting and captivity, you have decided to provide them with additional support... From now on, 12 hours after capturing the girls, the victor must release them and refrain from attempting to capture them again unless they initiate aggression! This will make things much more fun, as these brave lady warriors will be able to fight over and over again!

### Heroine Legend

You yourself will spread the legend that a villain like you can only be defeated by an innocent warrior maiden... And of course, your black aura will weaken her with every piece of clothing she wears! So pretty soon you'll only be attacked by young, practically naked girls! All you have to do is play along with them and make it look like just a little more, and she wins!

### Valkyries

To make this ridiculous legend a little more realistic, you will create an elite squad of beautiful monster hunters who will fight naked! Of course, it won't be easy to create or obtain the right artifacts for them, but the sight of naked and beautiful in their fury Valkyries will definitely be worth it!

### Public Punishment

Punishment? No, not whips or torture, that would be barbaric! Maybe you could just leave them in the pillory, completely helpless and blindfolded, and let the citizens decide how to punish them! It would be totally fair, because not only could they get fucked, but they could also just get slapped on the ass a few times, or even wrapped in a blanket if everyone decided they're not that guilty!

### General Law

Wait, did you ban whores in the first place? What the hell? Oh, she went to the pillory herself to entertain the crowd and make some money while there are no real criminals around? Well, that's misuse of public property, which is punishable by severe penalties! So now she's going to have to stand here for a few more hours, ha! It may look a little strange, but the law is the law! However, she can keep on collecting donations!

### Education

Oops... Looks like your innovative ideas are catching on with the people... Maybe even too well... So now it's not just desperate criminals being punished this way, but it seems to have become part of the normal educational process! Huh, looks like it's going to be harder for bad girls to study in university! Although it will probably still make them spend more time studying if they don't want their ass to be sore later!

### Training

You won't execute even the most violent and desperate criminals! For what? They can still be good slaves if you put a little effort into it... So you'd better create a special center for their proper training! Just a few weeks and they will be completely submissive and will do anything to be fucked as often as possible for fear of being sent back for re-education! All their thoughts will be on dicks, not crimes!

### Slaves' Rights

Well... You can't ban slavery, it's post-apocalyptic and all that, right? But you can certainly create the best conditions for slave girls in your kingdom! No more than six hours of rape per day! Guaranteed supply of the best lube! Medical insurance! Even a pension if she attends advanced training and serves her master faithfully! You're even willing to take runaway slaves from other lands, give them free plastic surgery, and find them new masters!

### Home Delivery

It's time to end this barbarism and cruelty! No more queuing in uncomfortable slave markets! You'll do whatever it takes to keep your customers happy! You'll even organize a special home delivery service for slave girls. There will even be an anonymous package for a one-night slave! No one will even notice the delivery because the girl will undress herself, unfold the box, and lie down right in front of your door!

### Coliseum

Surely you will not tolerate underground bloody rings on your land! No death arenas or fighting pits! Only the official coliseum, where specially trained girls will perform! Here will be the hottest "fights" in the whole wasteland! "Battles with beasts and monsters, tournaments for sex slaves, invited guests and much more! Surely it will soon become one of the most popular places in your kingdom, and the girls will become real stars!

### Slutty Games

Looks like your arena has become so popular that it has become a real privilege to perform there! Many girls even organize local clubs and train tirelessly, dreaming of one day performing in the Coliseum! Well, you can't let them down! Every 2 years you will organize the most elite Slutty Games to find out which girl is the best! In addition to unquestionable fame and glory, all the winners will receive generous prizes from you, and you will even fuck them all personally as a souvenir!

### Family Traditions

It just so happens that all the important families in your kingdom have acquired their own unique kinks... Eventually, it became so common that they not only stopped being ashamed of it, but started flaunting it, making it their symbol, almost like a coat of arms! Ha, in high society it even became unseemly not to have a weird kink! And after the wedding, they spend months training new family members to appreciate their clan fetishes!

### Cleaners

A man's sperm is too precious a substance to be wiped off with a rag! So from now on, it can only be licked! In many places, there will be special girls who can always be asked to lick it clean. And whores will often organize whole shows on the street as an advertisement.

### Doesn't Count

Sex with a condom is no longer considered rape or even sex. After all, the penis didn't even touch the pussy, so there's nothing to complain about! It's almost the same as accidentally touching each other with your pelvis, only the clothes are much thinner!

### Treasure

Serving men is recognized as an extremely important occupation. So much so that you have officially allowed girls to use condoms filled with fresh semen instead of money in stores! After all, this is direct proof that they were good girls and made someone feel good!

### Anonymous Hookers

Any girl can easily and quickly make money by offering her bare ass and putting a price tag on it. She does not even have to show her face or communicate with the client in any way. No one will ever dare to find out the identity of an anonymous hooker or try to cheat on the payment.

### Guaranteed Payment

The fines for not paying prostitutes will be so high that guys will pay all girls for any sex, just in case. It will become so commonplace that even rapists will stick a few big bills up their victims' asses. 

### Quality Control

In your kingdom, everything must be perfect! That includes a chick's pussy, of course! So your guards will often check to see how well their pubic hair is trimmed and how well their pussy is taken care of!

### Loincloth

Pretty girls spend way too much time choosing clothes! This is ridiculous, because their main treasure is their body, not rags! So they tried to make it indecent for hotties to wear anything but loincloths! ...Hey, how did they come up with 200 styles of plain cloth in just one week!

### Sexy Bots

Faceless robots and golems look too creepy and intimidating, so you made a special law that any mechanical, electronic, or magical doll must not only resemble a human, but also have a sexual appearance and a functional sex organ!

### Legalize

To increase the birth rate, you've decided to legalize rape. There are severe penalties for the use of contraceptives or active resistance! But if the man doesn't cum in her pussy, the girl will be able to report him to the police! You don't need such useless rapists here!

### Blowjob Hour

Ugh, looks like the guys are too into rape... They seem to have too much passion and lust. That's why you have declared the "Blowjob Hour"! From noon to 1 pm, all girls must give a blowjob to anyone who asks for one! Surely this will reduce the number of rapes and make their lives easier!

### On a Leash

Girls on the street will always have to wear a collar and leash, which should be held by the guy in charge of them. This way there will be no confusion, because everyone will clearly see who she belongs to!

### Full Set

Hmmm... It seems that a simple leash is not enough to instill in a girl a sense of total submission to her master... It just means that more toys should be used! That way, even the most insolent bitch will soon realize her place!

### Packaged

Do these sex slaves still allow themselves disgruntled looks? What cheeks! Well, you have a special remedy for them.... A special carrier that will make sure all their holes are filled to the brim, leaving them obedient and helpless!

### Travelers

Oh, of course you respect travelers and visitors to your kingdom! Their girls will be treated especially well! They will receive special packaging and a special cart to transport them! They can even be left with the luggage while the guests have fun!

### Café

Remembering the good old days, you decide to revive an abandoned succubus cafe... You thought you'd have to find waitresses, whores, and other staff, but it turns out that as soon as your capital got big enough, the succubi reappeared, ready to serve all comers!

## Chapter 14

- = Final Goal = -

## 

   Your Golden Age has finally arrived.

   You live happily with your companion in a magnificent city that belongs to you. The new rules allow you to fully enjoy your well-deserved fame and power. And most importantly, your kingdom no longer needs your constant attention and will develop on its own, allowing you to relax and take a break.

   But will you be able to live such a long, happy, boring and monotonous life? Or will your restless mind find a new purpose for itself? A new task, a new height to conquer?

### Hedonist

Ehhh... Oh, to hell with it! The last few, um... The last hundred years have been pretty shitty, and you're already tired of always having something to be afraid of, something to strive for, something to develop... maybe it's time to just relax a little for yourself! Wine, girls, fun in the city... What more could you want?

### Tyranny

Only with steely order in your kingdom can you bring order to the world! Only then can you subdue all those wild barbarians and bring civilization! And you will stop at nothing to strengthen your position of power!

### Dark Empire

To develop the community? What for? Right now, all you need are reliable performers who don't ask questions. Reliable soldiers who will not retreat or run away! First, conquer the world, and then you can start thinking about what kind of society you want to build!

### Eternal War

War, blood and fury so invigorate your spirit! Danger, freedom, the right weapon and the firm hand on which your fate, your very life depends! That's how men should live! Apocalypse was so beautiful that you decided to repeat some of its aspects and plunge the whole world into eternal war!

### Conquests

After conquering a kingdom, you capture queens just to play with them a bit and let them go back. You even help them regain power after they return to their lands. After all, what's the point of conquering everything at once? Who are you going to fight and have fun with?

### Golden Million

Instead of trying to develop the whole of humanity, you decide to concentrate your efforts on just one big city. With advanced technology, you don't need hundreds of thousands of factories, so you'll definitely pollute the planet less! And the remaining humans? Well... That's their problem.

### Communism

The damned capitalists will no longer be able to stop the triumph of socialism! You will build a true utopia where everyone will be equal! Real communism! You may have to sacrifice some of your property for the benefit of the workers' party, but you can be sure that under your wise leadership you will be able to build the best and fairest society possible!

### World Ruler

To prove to everyone around you and to yourself that you are not just a fool lucky enough to have advanced technology, but actually the wisest of all rulers, you decide... Become the ruler of the world without resorting to war or threats! You're sure that if you rule with enough balance and fairness, your neighbors will want to join you! Whole cities and countries will overthrow their foolish rulers to be under your wise leadership!

### Techno-Barbarians

Teaching people, explaining the principles of advanced technology? Ha, screw it! Are you sure it will only cause more problems, because what people really need is religion, not knowledge! You'd rather build techno temples and have people serve technology without even understanding how it works! At least they'll be easier to control and won't invent anything too dangerous!

### Luddite Ruler

The further progress of humanity is shit!  You've already seen what this goddamn technology can do! And you won't let it happen again! You'd rather destroy and ban all advanced technology! Even gunpowder! You will downplay technology and elevate the role of the individual and personal skill! Take humanity back to the Middle Ages and make it perfect so that everyone can live in happiness! 

### Adventure Mode

Ughhh... Your own bunker, city, kingdom... It's a lot of fun in its own way, but it seems like you're getting tired of it. People can take care of themselves, so you might as well go on another adventure! Heh, you'd love to spend years wandering the planet, fighting monsters and tyrants, rescuing innocent maidens, and partying in every tavern! With your powers, you will surely become a legendary hero!

### Artifact Hunting

Civilization? People? Progress? Oh, let them fend for themselves! There are still too many mysteries in this world for you to solve! Ancient ruins and catacombs that your double from this world knew nothing about, and that didn't even exist in other realms. Mysterious cults with secret knowledge, anomalies, amazing scientific and magical artifacts! You explore it all, no matter how long it takes!

### The Wall

Oh, those barbarians from the ruins are always trying to infiltrate your prosperous kingdom... Enough, you no longer need cheap and uneducated labor! They're only ruining your economy and causing trouble in the streets, distracting your citizens! So you will build a huge wall around your entire kingdom to stop the monsters and migrants!

### Slave Master

You decide to take slavery to a whole new level! Your kingdom will not only become the largest slave trading center in the world, but it will also train and prepare the best elite slave girls! Hell, even if you have to spend more medicine and effort on them than on free citizens, you'll turn each slave into a perfect, obedient beauty with a college education!

### Protector of Mankind

Universal equality? With Orcs? Goblins? Does anyone think you'll ever accept that ridiculous idea? Of course humanity should be superior to all other races! And you will do anything to make everyone fear and respect humanity! You will elevate mankind to the point where all others will be nothing more than their loyal slaves!

### …And Justice for All

In the end, it is not so much the political idea that matters, but the rigor and fairness of the laws. Therefore, you will strive to create not only an ideal set of laws, but also universal equality before the law. No more lobbyists and no more corruption! You will even create a world court and become its chief judge. And you will make sure that no one escapes just punishment!

### Babylon Reverse

They are tired of these barbarians distorting languages and inventing new ones! You remember dozens of languages from past worlds, but after the Apocalypse, almost every group of survivors created their own dialects! The hell with that! You'll create a language so simple and easy to use that no one will ever think of changing it! Ever! Hell, you'll even try to make it innate!

### GECK

To help people restore other lands, you will try to create small portable kits with all the necessary tools, instructions, and seeds to find water anywhere and create beautiful gardens of Eden. Of course, you'll only give them to the most deserving of the savages! Only the chosen ones!

### Terraforming

Even a hundred years after the cataclysm, the land is still covered in eerie ashes and deadly wastelands, so you decide to put all your efforts into rebuilding nature. It will probably take decades, but mankind should take care of its home planet at least once in a while, right?

### Sapling of the World Tree

It will be difficult and dangerous, but you're sure you can use the portal rig to find the World Tree in one of the worlds, break off a tiny twig.... and escape before the guards kill you! That sapling will surely make your world much more beautiful and make nature much richer!

### Homemade Magic

No matter how hard you try, magic is still too complicated for ordinary people... But you've already found a solution! You just need to create a new techno-magic! You'll launch hundreds of battle satellites, and all the "wizard" has to do is wave his arms in the proper manner, and all-seeing orbital lasers will strike his opponent! Maybe you'll even let them affect the weather a bit, make it rain or something!

### Horny Fantasy

Making magic is so boring... So you decided to indulge yourself and make it as twisted and exciting as possible! To hell with wizards, now witches will do the magic, and their power will depend on how beautiful and naked they are! You'll have to hold mass orgies to summon rain, the juice of medicinal GMO fruits will have to be injected anally, and of course you'll create a lot of horny monsters! 

### Incubators

Uh... Humans are so slow to reproduce... Even with all your rules and lots of sex, there are just too few! Seems like it would be easier to build giant incubator factories and raise tens of thousands of babies at once! Oh, then you'll put them in foster homes or something...

### Perfect Race

That's right! Why limit yourself to ordinary humans when you can create a new, perfect race in your labs? Of course, you'll make sure they never get sick, feed on light, see the full spectrum, float in the air, and are perfectly adapted to weightlessness, because one day they'll be going into space!

### Neko

It doesn't matter how long it takes you, but you will create the most playful and cheerful catgirls and the proudest and most majestic elves! Who cares what people think, it will definitely make this world a little more beautiful and fun!

### Pokemons

You've dreamed of assembling a team of Pokémon since you were a kid... And since the world is full of monsters and mutants anyway, why don't you let some more out? At least these ones will be cute and trainable!

### Patriarch

You are a unique specimen of a human being with amazing abilities! You can't let such excellent genes go to waste! In order to improve the gene pool of humanity, you should have many children! After all, one of your offspring might inherit one of your powers! Hundreds! No, a thousand! Hell, have a hundred thousand children and become the patriarch of the new humanity!

### Clones

You are tired of dealing with these stupid savages and barbarians! You were much smarter than the people around you in the previous world, and now no one understands you at all - they just have too low an IQ! Ughh... Fine! You'll just create some of your own clones with a copy of your memory! That way you'll always have someone to talk to, and you can trust them with the most important things! Or maybe create a few thousand clones at once?

### Resurrection

So many of your friends and loved ones died in that cataclysm long ago... Hell, it wiped out an entire civilization that few people even remember! Ahh... If only there was some way... Wait! There really is a way to bring them back! It'll take a hell of a lot of mana, but you can resurrect them! It may take tens of years, hundreds of years, but you can resurrect everyone who died in that nightmare! 

### Superior Being

Why do you even want these people? Of course you were bored, you were desperate... But you're okay now, right? You're already so much better than all of them, because of the Fusion, you have amazing powers and memories, you've even managed to live for a hundred years without aging! You must continue to evolve and develop! You have the technology! In time, you can become an all-powerful, immortal superhuman who no longer needs humanity and a bunker to continue to exist and evolve!

## Chapter 15

- = Epilogue = -

## 



### Toy

You once thought that Yandere's girlfriend would be fun... Afterwards, you hoped that you could control her madness, since you had all the power in your hands! Huh... You even thought she wasn't so obsessed with her crazy love anymore... Well, she did a good job of pretending to let your guard down... She was very patient, and there you were - chained to her bed. And she still loves you more than life and will play with you day after day until the end of time! 

### Adrenaline Maniac

You are too used to constant danger and risk, to always striving, fighting, struggling, overcoming! And when you finally find yourself in a peaceful and quiet society, you feel terribly uncomfortable. It may have been your goal for so many years, but once you achieved it, you realized that you were no longer fit for a peaceful life.

### Absolute Stealing

Haha, after all these years, you have managed to not only master this legendary spell, but improve on it! Now you can not only steal panties, but all clothes, armor and weapons at once!

### World For You

Of course, you already know who Saya is. A monster, one of those nightmarish creatures you once saw between worlds. Or rather, a Seed that must germinate in the new world, distorting it and turning it into something else. But she was so young when she came to this world! She liked human culture so much! And she especially liked you! 

### SuccuBots

You've finally figured out what happened to your succubots that gathered energy for you a hundred years ago! As you feared, they were all captured by real succubi in the end! But the demons didn't break such great sex dolls, they hid them away for safekeeping! And now, when their cafe has an unusually large number of customers, when all the girls are busy and there is not a single free hole, they activate your succubi as helpers!

### Voluntary Slaves

You were able to do more than just make the lives of the poor slave girls a little better... No, you've made their lives so fun and colorful that many girls come to your kingdom to become sex slaves themselves! They know that they will be well taken care of here and that they will find the best master! Ha, some are even willing to pay a decent amount of money to enjoy a few months of sex slave life!

### Trendsetters

Not so long ago, the outside world rightly considered the fashion in your lands to be insane and overly lustful, but... It's hard to be proud of your puritanical bra and panties when you're literally just a rude barbarian against the backdrop of a great empire! So soon your rich and prosperous kingdom became a true trendsetter around the world! 

### Vacation

Damn, those MazeShow brats really pissed you off! You want to go to the resort too! You remember that shiny, fun-filled, lustful mirage in the sea! Their damned defense! If only you had more powerful tools, things could have turned out totally different! And that cheeky succubus wouldn't even open a portal to this paradise for you for a week! Aaargh! Who cares what she says, the resort isn't ready yet? What the hell, you just make your own! With blackjack and hookers! 

### Horned Nuns

Much to your surprise, your religion has become extremely popular among demonesses and succubi! So much so that many of them have even become your nuns! These naughty ones don't follow the usual rules, but they're more than happy to call you Daddy and let your parishioners play with them for days on end! Needless to say, your temples are now always full of people?

### Dark Matter

In time, you realized that these beings between worlds, the Dark Gods, were not necessarily pure evil. Perhaps they should be seen as one of the laws of nature? How can gravity be evil? Or how can you fight dark matter, which almost certainly has something to do with them? But that's what inventors do, right? They learn how to circumvent the laws of nature! You already have antigravity! Surely you can figure out how to save mankind from another cataclysm, because you have millennia ahead of you!

### Crossroads of Worlds

No matter what happened, you continued your research on the portals. Yes, it was dangerous as hell, but you were sure you could stabilize the system! Not only did you learn how to open the passages yourself, but you also created a special beacon so that other travelers could safely visit you without risking another portal storm. Thus, creatures from many different worlds began to appear in your kingdom!

### Fortress

You're so used to feeling safe in your bunker that you've decided to turn your city into an absolute, impregnable fortress! Over time, you have ripped it out of reality altogether, hiding it in another space, leaving only portal bridges. Now, even if another apocalypse befalls the world, you and your people will be fine!

### Watchmen

Seriously concerned about the future of this world, you created a secret order of Watchmen. You gathered the most loyal and trustworthy people, helped them organize dozens of secret hideouts, provided them with the best technology and secret knowledge. You did everything you could to make this world another independent force that will do everything to prevent the next cataclysm or at least save civilization once again!

### Night Fears

You thought that these ominous shadows had grown weaker with time and fallen behind you, but it seems that they just lurked. In the years that followed, they attacked you several more times, as if to test you. You may be too strong for them now, but their patience and ability to attack at the most inopportune times has made you uneasy. After all, you still don't understand what they are!

### Shadows

"You will be a part of it"? Hmmm... Come to think of it, those shadow creatures changed significantly every time you saw them. A wild, violent pack at first, and then a clearly intelligent, cunning creature.... They're clearly banding together, getting stronger and stronger... Hmm. It was one of your craziest experiments, but when you found one of the wild shadows, you merged with it! Ha, you knew it! Too weak to defeat you, it became a part of you and began to serve you! These shadows are clearly just fragments of something greater, and they can give you great power if you can conquer them!

### Dark Lord

Your cruel empire is hated by all sentient beings, and your name has become synonymous with evil, depravity, and malice. People curse you, but you do not care about the petty threats of these mortals. The main thing is that every day, your strength and power grow, and your armies conquer more and more lands!

### Cultist

Corruption? Oh, what folly! You have shed your old fears and prejudices and dedicated yourself to serving your new masters! They have given you eternity and the secret knowledge of how to draw power from human fear and suffering! Your body is slightly distorted, but it is a small thing, for soon you will sacrifice another world to them!

### Lab Rat

You yourself were very interested in the amazing features of your body, so of course you agreed to some experiments... Harmless at first, they became more and more sophisticated, and eventually you realized with horror that you had no control over anything and could not escape. Once a great scientist, you now find yourself in the position of a powerless laboratory mouse.

### New Game +

Over time, you've reflected on your amazing journey. If you had done things differently, things could have turned out very differently! Huh, you've made so many stupid mistakes... This realization annoyed you more and more until you finally decided to live it all over again! It's dangerous, of course, but you're sure you'll be able to go back in time to the moment of the Fusion! This time you'll do it better!

### Limitless

It took centuries, but eventually you evolved to the point where you became the strongest being in your world. You became so absurdly strong that at one point you decided to go back in time, to your original world, which you escaped through a portal system. Apocalypse? Ha! Let him taste your fists! Now you're ready to fight and win!

### Wake Up

You knew it, you believed it all those terrifying years! This nightmare can't be real! And now you finally wake up in front of a screen with a silly CYOA... You... Did you just fall asleep while reading the story? But... What about your friends? Your companion, your new family? Your city and your superpowers!? Damn, was it all just a dream? You almost sobbed and grabbed your pillow, wanting to fall asleep again, to never wake up again, to stay in this world, but it was too late.

### Young God

You have reached the limit of human development and have gone further. Your power is beyond anything humanity can imagine. You can destroy entire worlds and create them from nothing. Huh... You thought that with such power you would be truly free and independent of everything, but in fact you have only attracted the attention of truly dangerous creatures...

### Prisoner

You thought the story of the mysterious bunker was over long ago and had almost forgotten about it when your world was invaded by a battle group of your doubles! You did not even have time to understand what their indestructible armor was made of and what kind of weapons they had in their hands when they immobilized and arrested you! What the hell? You didn't attack that bunker, it just appeared in your world! You were set up! And damn it, when did your doubles even have time to create an interdimensional police force?

### Screw It

Hell, you thought you could build a cool and fun kingdom, become a popular and wise ruler... But every day the problems got bigger and bigger... Everyone thought of you as an ugly perv! Those bastards stole almost all of your supplies as "compensation" and then started fighting with you like you were some kind of villain! And a wandering horde of monsters destroyed almost everything you'd built... Hell, you have nothing left but your bunker, and the whole world is against you! Aah, screw it! You can make an apocalypse and just start over! You'll do better next time! 

### Torn World

You knew they were dangerous experiments, but you couldn't stop. Your portals are so damn important! You were sure everything would be fine, but another experiment caused an even worse Portal Storm that literally tore the world apart. Luckily, the emergency system managed to teleport you to a new world! A beautiful, prosperous world... Which will surely be the site of another Dark Gods game soon... Huh. It's amazing how you used to really believe that they were totally evil... Until you destroyed a whole dimension yourself...
